# Chapter 1: Introduction

In this chapter, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What is an overhead environment?
- What is cavern diving?
- Why take Cavern Diver training?
- What can you expect during your Cavern Diver course?

## What Is An Overhead Environment?

An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.

## What is Cavern Diving?

Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within sight of the entrance.

Any time divers venture beyond sight of the cavern entrance, they are cave diving and not cavern diving. And, when the sun goes down, every cavern is considered a cave.

Cavern diving differs from cave diving in the following ways:

Cavern diving requires little more than standard single-tank, sport-diving equipment. Cave diving requires highly specialized equipment, such as backmount or sidemount doubles.
divers_gearing_up

TDI Full Cave Diver certification requires a minimum of six or more days of training and 16 or more dives. TDI Cavern Diver certification requires as little as two days of training and four dives.

Cave diving is a form of technical diving that takes divers beyond accepted sport-diving limits. Cavern diving takes place within normal sport-diving depth and time limits.

## Cavern Diver Training Benefits

Why take part in TDI Cavern Diver training?

> The benefits of Cavern Diver training go beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.

- Cavern diving helps divers develop exceptional buoyancy control and trim.
- It helps divers streamline their equipment to avoid entanglement and improve overall function.
- It introduces advanced dive planning procedures used by technical divers. In fact, the Cavern Diver course closely parallels the TDI Intro to Tech Diver course.
- It is the first step in a process that can lead to TDI Introductory Cave Diver and Full Cave Diver certification. It is also a good precursor to Advanced Wreck Diver training.

## About the Cavern Diver Course

The TDI Cavern Diver course consists of:

- Self-study
- Academic review
- Guideline and emergency skill practice on dry land
- Guideline and emergency skill practice in shallow water
- Several cavern dives

The Cavern Diver course emphasizes the importance of pre-planning and gas management when exploring overhead environments. Why?

> When diving in open water, divers generally can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an overhead obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

## Chapter 1: Summary

- An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.
- Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within direct sight of the entrance.
- The benefits inherent in taking Cavern Diver training goes beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.
- When diving in open water, divers can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

# Chapter 2: Land

## Landowner Relations and Conservation

To be able to go cavern diving, we first need a place to dive. This can only happen if:

- Landowners grant permission to dive.
- We protect the fragile cavern environment so it’s worth diving there.

Here, we’ll discuss the diver’s responsibility in landowner relations and conservation.

### Landowner Relations

When dealing with the individuals, organizations and government entities that either own the land on which the caverns and caves you dive are located, or own the land that provides access to these sites, remember these two key points:

- There is no unowned land.
- Our access depends on following the rules.
- There is no unowned land.

Do not assume that undeveloped, unfenced or unposted land “doesn’t really belong to anyone.” It does—and regardless of whether the owner is an individual, business or organization, or a government agency, the owner has the right to allow or deny access to the property.

Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.

This goes beyond just avoiding arrest for trespassing. Future access to the site may depend on cavern and cave divers gaining a reputation as people who respect property rights.

**Our access depends on following the rules.**

Most popular underwater caverns and caves are located in government controlled or privately operated parks and recreation sites. These sites typically have and enforce various rules applying to divers of different training and experience levels.

> Understand and follow all rules in effect at dive sites.

Your willingness to follow the rules may determine if you and others are allowed future access to popular sites.

## Cavern and Cave Conservation

Underwater caverns and caves are fragile environments that must be treated with respect and care.

To avoid damaging a cavern or cave site: **Match the site to your skill level.**

Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.

Use the right propulsion technique. The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

Remember that any damage you cause to the fragile cavern/cave environment will be visible forever. Fragile stone formations and speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) take tens of thousands of years to form. Once damaged they will not grow back.

Even something as seemingly innocuous as a hand or fin print in a bed of clay can remain visible beyond our lifetimes. The only possible way to deal with such damage is to prevent it.

## Chapter 2: Summary

- Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.
- Understand and follow the rules at the dive site.
- Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.
- The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

# Chapter 3: Cave Type and Formation

The more you know about the environment in which you dive, the more you will appreciate and enjoy the experience. This is as true of caverns as it is of coral reefs.

In this chapter, we answer the following questions:

- What are the different types of caves and caverns?
- How do solution caves and caverns form?

## Cave Types

There are at least four different cavern and cave types.

The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes and solution caves.

Let’s take a look at what makes each type unique.

### Coral caves

Coral caves typically form when the tops of adjacent coral reefs grow together, forming tunnels and arches. They are common along the edges of walls and drop-offs.

### Sea caves

Formed by wave action eroding limestone or other soft rock, sea caves tend to penetrate the cliffs in which they form for only a short distance. During all but the highest tides, the ceilings of most sea caves are open to air.

### Lava tubes

A byproduct of volcanic eruptions, lava tubes form when the outside of a lava flow cools and hardens, while the interior remains molten. If the lava flow abruptly terminates, the molten core may empty out, leaving a hollow conduit.

### Solution caves

These form when the carbonic acid present in groundwater dissolves soft rock, such as limestone or dolomite. Solution caves often form a series of complex, maze-like passageways.

Most caverns and caves are found in karst topography, which is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and gypsum.

## Karst Topography

_(Note: This section inserted by me. -Ed.)_

**Karst topography** is a distinctive type of landscape formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, primarily limestone, dolomite, and gypsum.

### Key Characteristics

- **Formation:** Created when slightly acidic water (from rain or groundwater) dissolves carbonate bedrock over thousands of years
- **Surface features:** Sinkholes, disappearing streams, springs, and irregular rocky terrain
- **Underground features:** Extensive cave systems, underground rivers, and caverns

### Relevance to Cave Diving

Karst topography is directly responsible for creating the cave systems that divers explore. Florida, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and many other popular cave diving destinations are karst regions where this geological process has created vast underwater cave networks.

The dissolution process creates:

- **Cenotes** (Mexico) - natural sinkholes providing access to underwater caves
- **Springs** (Florida) - outlets where underground water emerges
- **Cave passages** - dissolved conduits through the limestone

This geological feature is fundamental to understanding why caves exist in certain regions and how they continue to evolve over time.

## Solution Cave Formation

Most karst terrain is nothing but layer upon layer of limestone, or calcium carbonate, covered with a thin layer of sand and clay. Limestone is a highly porous rock; the limestone in most karst regions is especially porous. Water moves easily between the loosely compacted particles and shells that comprise most of this rock.

When rain falls on karst terrain, the ground absorbs it almost immediately. Before it is absorbed, the rainwater acquires carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and the decaying organic matter it passes through. When combined with the hydrogen and oxygen in water (H2O), the carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid (H2CO3).

[!image](/img/027.jpg)

The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.

[!image](/img/028.jpg)

One example of this solution process is called spongework. This occurs when carbonic acid dissolves pockets of softer limestone, leaving rock that resembles Swiss cheese.

[!image](/img/029.jpg)

When rain falls on highly porous karst terrain, it is absorbed into the ground, saturating the limestone below.

[!image](/img/030.jpg)

Rivers passing through the region often have water levels lower than the surrounding water table. Gravity creates a tendency for water to move sideways through the rock as the water tries to run downhill.

[!image](/img/031.jpg)

Ground water seeks the path of least resistance. This can include bedding planes (the boundary between limestone layers), fractures in the rock and even interconnecting spongework. As this takes place, the carbonic acid works to further dissolve these conduits.

When passage diameter exceeds nine centimeters, the rate of dissolution accelerates. Thus, the biggest conduits for water flow tend to become even bigger over time. Eventually, these can form an interconnecting maze of cave passageways.

[!image](/img/032.jpg)

Mature cave systems may surface in a spring basin, away from the river, and connect to the river by a spring run.

## Cavern and Cave Entrance Types

Cavern and cave entrances may be either springs or siphons. A sinkhole or karst window may have both.

Springs exist where water flows out of the ground. Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.

Siphons form in one of two ways.

[!image](/img/33.jpg)

If the level of adjacent rivers rises above that of the water table, karst openings that are normally springs may temporarily siphon.

[!image](/img/34.jpg)

The development of sinkholes over underground rivers often creates openings with a spring on one side and a siphon on the other.

Diving springs is almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

The opposite is true for siphons. Additionally, divers entering siphons may experience substantially lower visibility than divers entering springs—especially in areas where siphons ingest tannic-stained water from adjacent rivers.

## Chapter 3 Summary

- The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes, and solution caves.
- The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.
- Springs exist where water flows out of the ground.
- Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.
- Diving springs are almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort, and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

# Chapter 4: Environmental Risks

Now that you know where underwater caverns and caves come from, it’s time to talk about the risks associated with diving them. To do this, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What are the risks associated with diving overhead environments?
- Why do siphons pose a greater risk than springs?
- What can cause loss of visibility and why is it a problem?
- What are restrictions and why should you avoid them?
- What are line traps and why should you avoid them?

## Overhead Environments

Aquatic environments can pose many risks for divers, the greatest of which is being out of breathing gas while underwater.

> Divers in open water almost always have the ability to make a direct ascent to the surface.

A direct ascent to the surface is not possible when cavern diving.

## Loss of Visibility

Why be concerned with maintaining good visibility?

> Loss of visibility can trigger more serious problems.

They include:

- Disorientation and confusion.
- Buddy separation and impeded communication.
- Losing sight of the guideline or exit.
- Substantially slower exit times; especially if divers need to spend time locating the guideline, the exit, or each other.

Loss of visibility can be caused by:

- Poor starting visibility.
- Siphoning.
- Disturbance of silts and sediments.

### Poor starting visibility

If the visibility inside a cavern is poor when entering, it will not likely improve. On the other hand, if you start in good visibility, a slight decrease in overall visibility is not likely to be a problem.

#### Siphoning

Siphons can suck in dark, tannic-laden river water or algae from an adjacent open-water basin. This can severely lower visibility.

#### Silt

Given good starting visibility, the greatest risk of loss of visibility comes from the disturbance of silt. Silt is a broad term that actually describes a range of sediments.

[!image](/img/38.jpg)

_(Note: I have only included this graphic because I think it's hilarious. -Ed.)_

- At one end of the continuum is sand. While easily disturbed, it drops out of suspension almost immediately.
- At the other end of the continuum is clay. While harder to disturb, once you do so it can take up to 24 hours or more to settle.

The best way to handle silting problems is to avoid them.

- Silt is common in areas with low flow, so be aware of water movement—or lack of it—in caverns.
- Pay attention to the bottom composition and learn to distinguish between sand, mud and clay.

To avoid or reduce silting, perfect your buoyancy control, trim and propulsion techniques.

## Siphons

Avoid siphons whenever possible, because:

> Siphons are often associated with poor visibility. Siphoning can make it difficult or impossible to exit a cavern.

Diving a siphon requires more time, energy and breathing gas to exit a cavern than you used when entering.
A mild siphon near the cavern entrance can turn into an overpowering one farther in. This poses an entrapment risk. The best way to deal with siphons is to avoid them.

## Restrictions

Among the limits of Cavern Diver training is a prohibition against passing through restrictions.

> A restriction is a passage or opening too narrow for divers to pass through side by side.

[!image](/img/40.jpg)

Negotiating restrictions, including air-sharing while passing through a restriction, requires specialized training that is not a part of Cavern Diver training. Minor restrictions are covered in the TDI Intro Cave and TDI Full Cave courses.

## Line Traps

Line traps are openings into which divers may accidentally pull the guideline but are too narrow for the divers to pass through.

[!image](/img/41.jpg)

> Line traps are dangerous because they prevent divers from exiting the cavern using the guideline. The ability to follow a guideline is critically important in low visibility.

When running reels, check behind you frequently to ensure your guideline has not fallen into a line trap.

## Chapter 4 Summary

- Divers in open water almost always have the ability to make a direct ascent to the surface. A direct ascent is not possible when cavern diving.
- Loss of visibility can trigger serious problems including disorientation and confusion, buddy separation and impeded communication, losing sight of the guideline or exit, and slower exit times.
- Siphons are often associated with poor visibility. Siphoning can make it difficult or impossible to exit a cavern.
- A restriction is a passage or opening too narrow for divers to pass through side by side.
- Line traps are dangerous because they prevent divers from exiting the cavern using the guideline. The ability to follow a guideline is critically important in low visibility.

# Chapter 5: Equipment

In this course we will determine if your current open-water gear is suitable for cavern diving and, if so, what modifications may be required before using it in overhead environments.

Equipment used for single-cylinder diving in open water can be modified for cavern diving. Specialized equipment including backmount or sidemount double cylinders or closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) can also be used for cavern diving.

If you intend to use backmount or sidemount doubles during the Cavern Diver course, you must already be properly trained to do so.

> Cavern diving equipment must meet specific objectives.

These objectives include:

- Securing or removing any dangling equipment that could cause entanglement, disturb silt or damage fragile cave formations.
- Eliminating unnecessary accessory items.
- Making critical equipment items instantly accessible by feel.
- Equipping for a streamlined and properly trimmed body position in the water.

## Mask, Snorkel, and Fins

The mask and fins you already own will likely be suitable for cavern diving.

### Masks and Snorkels

> Nearly any mask that fits well is suitable for cavern diving.

Snorkels are not used for cavern diving because they are an entanglement risk and are useless in overhead environments.

Most cave and technical divers carry a backup mask that can be stowed in a pocket.

### Fins

Only open-heel scuba fins are adequate for cavern diving. They must be designed to allow specialized propulsion techniques used by cavern divers to avoid silting.

Split and hinged fins generally do not work well when doing the frog kick, helicopter turn, or modified flutter kick used by cavern divers to avoid silting.

#### Avoiding strap problems

Loose or dangling straps are a guideline entanglement hazard.

> Mask and fins straps must be secured.

Before easily adjustable, quick-release fin strap buckles were developed, cavern and cave divers taped the loose ends of fin straps so that they could not snare the guideline. This isn’t necessary with most modern fins.

A better alternative is to use spring or elastic heel straps. These are standard on most technical diving fins and available as an after-market accessory for most others.

A good way to rid your mask of loose strap ends is to replace it with a neoprene strap that has no loose ends. Another approach is to wear your mask strap under your hood. Doing this also helps prevent mask loss.

## Exposure Suits

Hypothermia is a potentially dangerous drop in body temperature usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Choosing the right exposure protection is important.

Factors to consider when selecting exposure protection include surface temperature, water temperature, length of exposure and depth.

A full-length exposure suit is essential in nearly all cavern environments. This is typically a 5-mm or thicker wetsuit. As temperatures drop below 24° C/75? F, a dry suit might be a better option.

### Exposure suit accessories

Hoods: A well-fitting hood is an important exposure protection accessory.

Thigh pockets: BC and harness-mounted pockets tend to have limited capacity and may be hard to access. Thigh pockets found on most dry suits have greater capacity and are easier to use. You can easily add thigh pockets to most wetsuits.

## Regulators

Here we will discuss using a normal sport-diving regulator attached to a single cylinder.

If using a single regulator first stage, it must be capable of supplying gas to two divers at depth.

A gas-sharing situation at depth puts considerable demand on a first stage.

## Alternate-Air-Source Configuration

A conventional sport-diving regulator system can be easily modified for cavern diving. It usually features:

- A short primary second stage hose.
- A slightly longer alternate-air-source second stage hose.
- An equally long high-pressure hose ending in an instrument console.

The sport-diving equipment configuration shown here has inherent drawbacks for cavern use, including:

- The longer alternate-air-source second stage can be harder to locate and pass quickly to an out-of-air diver.
- It is easy to accidentally pass the alternate upside down, which can cause the recipient to inhale water, adding to panic.
- As usually configured, the alternate-air-source hose presents a snagging risk.
- Although you can use a conventional alternate-air-source second stage for cavern diving, consider switching to a primary second stage with a long hose for gas sharing.

The equipment configuration shown here offers several benefits, including:

- It allows you to pass the primary second stage to a distressed diver, allowing you to initiate gas sharing faster.
- Your natural wrist motion when passing a primary second stage tends to keep it right-side up.
- While many conventional “octopus” second stages are not designed for ease of breathing, your primary second stage should offer excellent performance. This is exactly what an out-of-gas diver needs.
- Because your backup second stage is worn on a necklace, it stays within easy reach.

This configuration is streamlined and reduces the risk of snagged hoses.

Inflator hoses that feature integrated regulators, which also suppose a potential donor will be passing his or her primary second stage, offer many of the same benefits. However, if not secured properly, the inflator hose may present an entanglement risk.

## BC Air Cell, Harness and Weight System

Cavern divers must equip and train to avoid silting.

> Your buoyancy compensator (BC) air cell, harness and weight system must be configured to help you maintain proper horizontal trim.

Modern weight-integrated BCs, especially those with trim weight pockets located on the upper portion of the BC, are preferred over traditional weight belts worn on the waist because the weights can be distributed along your body’s natural balance point.

Many students use the Cavern Diver course as an opportunity to switch to a harness and air cell system commonly used by cavern and cave divers. The benefits of these systems include:

- The back-mounted air cell may help in maintaining proper trim. Users can switch to air cells of different sizes.
- Modular systems make it possible to reposition D-rings or add accessories such as weight pockets.
- Many modular systems allow the same harness to be adapted for use with doubles or sidemount.

If your ultimate goal is to progress to cave or tech diver training, consider investing in a modular harness and air cell system.

## Instrumentation

Just as in open water, your dive data must be readily accessible when cavern diving.

Your instrumentation needs to include a means of monitoring depth, time, no-decompression status and cylinder pressure.

Minimum instrumentation for cavern diving includes:

- A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) calibrated in either 10-bar or 100-psi increments. This is crucial for dive planning and gas management.
- A means of monitoring both depth and time, such as a dive computer or depth gauge and timer.

Additionally:

- If you have a gas-integrated dive computer that reads cylinder pressure, plan to back it up with a mechanical gauge.
- Do not rely on a single means of monitoring depth, time, and no-decompression status. This means equipping with a backup dive computer or dive tables.
- Instruments such as thermometers and compasses have little value in cavern diving.
- All equipment must be attached securely to the diver’s BC or harness. Dangling gear is an entanglement hazard.

Most cave and technical divers avoid using a multi-gauge instrument console, relying instead on a mechanical SPG on a relatively short high-pressure hose. They use wrist-mounted dive computers and depth gauge/timers.

## Chapter 5 Summary

- Cavern diving equipment must meet specific objectives.
- Nearly any mask used for open-water diving is suitable for cavern diving.
- Mask and fin straps must be secured to prevent possible snagging.
- Snorkels are not used for cavern diving because they are an entanglement risk and are useless in overhead environments.
- Factors to consider when selecting exposure protection include surface temperature, water temperature, length of exposure and depth.
- If using a single regulator first stage, it must be capable of supplying gas to two divers at depth.
- Although you can use a conventional alternate-air-source second stage for cavern diving, consider switching to a primary second stage with a long hose for gas sharing.
- Your BC air cell, harness and weight system must be configured to help you maintain proper horizontal trim.
- Your instrumentation needs to include a means of monitoring depth, time, no-decompression status and cylinder pressure.

# Chapter 6: Specialized Equipment for Cavern Diving

As a cavern diver, you will use several items that are not normally part of sport diving in open water, including:

- Reels and spools for backup navigation in case you lose sight of the exit.
- Primary and backup lights to ensure you are never without a light source to augment sunlight entering the cavern.
- Attachment hardware to prevent items such as lights and reels from becoming lost or causing damage.
- Cutting tools in case of entanglement.
- Line markers, which are useful in missing diver scenarios.

Let’s take a look at each of these.

## Reels and Spools

Cave divers primarily navigate using permanent guidelines installed in the cave, while cavern divers generally do not.

- Cave divers use reels and spools to make temporary connections between permanent guidelines and the cave entrance or other guidelines.
- Cavern divers typically use a single temporary guideline connecting them with the cavern entrance.
- Some dive sites, such as those used for guided cavern dives, have lines permanently installed so that temporary guidelines are not needed.

### Reels and spools: what’s the difference?

A spool is a cylindrical device onto which line can be wound. A reel is a spool with additional features, including:

- An axle
- A winding knob
- A lockdown screw or mechanism
- A frame
- A handle
- An attachment clip

[!image](/img/65.jpg)

Reels are typically larger than spools. Some reel designs feature a handle on top. Newer designs tend to have a side-mounted handle.

[!image](/img/66.jpg)

Spools consist of just the spool itself, coupled with a double-ended snap used for carrying the spool and clipping it off.

- Compared with spools of the same capacity, reels are larger and heavier. They cannot be stowed in pockets and must be carried externally, clipped off to D-rings.
- Reels are slightly more difficult to use than spools.

The biggest drawback of reels is that they can jam. A jammed reel can be difficult to fix while underwater.

[!image](/img/67.jpg)

- Spools are compact and can fit into pockets, reducing the risk of loss or entanglement.
- Spools are easier to use and require less practice.
- The biggest advantage of spools is that, with the exception of “bird’s nesting”—line piling up on one side of the spool—they are almost impossible to jam.

Still, conventional reels are often preferred over spools for two reasons:

- Using a spool to wind up more than a few meters/feet of guideline can cause wrist strain. This is why most cavern divers use spools only to cover short distances or for use in place of a safety reel to eliminate the risk of a reel jamming.
- [!image](/img/68.jpg)
- The act of winding a guideline around a spool tends to put a twist in the line. After a few uses, you may need to unwind the spool, straighten the line, then rewind it.

Most cavern and cave divers use conventional reels for long distances and spools for short distances or in place of a safety reel.

### Reel and spool categories

Reels and spools generally fall into one of four categories:

[!image](/img/69.jpg)

- Exploration reels are the largest and capable of carrying several hundred meters/feet of guideline. These are used in the exploration and mapping of virgin caves.
- Primary reels typically carry 75-150 m/250-500 ft of guideline. Cave divers generally use them to connect a cave entrance to a permanent guideline or to explore off a permanent guideline. Cavern diving teams use them as their primary means of navigation.
- Safety reels and spools typically carry 40 m/125 ft or more of guideline. These are used in emergency situations, such as if divers become lost off the guideline.
- Jump reels and spools are used by cave divers to make temporary connections between permanent guideline. They come in a variety of sizes and will generally carry at least 6 m/20 ft of line. Cavern divers generally do not use them.

[!image](/img/70.jpg)

> Cavern diving teams must carry at least one primary reel per team and one safety reel or spool per diver.

## Lights

\_(Note: All images removed. They aren't helpful. -Ed.)

Each team member needs to have three light sources.

Because cavern divers dive during daylight hours and remain within clear sight of the entrance, the sun counts as the primary source of light for cavern diving.

### Primary dive lights

Your primary dive light is the one you use throughout the dive. Your backup light is used in the event of primary light failure.

What makes a light suitable as a primary light for cavern diving?

- Output: Select a primary light rated for 1,000 lumens or more. Your light’s output should be comparable with your teammates’ lights. A teammate using a significantly less powerful light risks accidentally being left behind because his or her buddies fail to notice their absence.
- Pattern: The best lights for cavern and cave diving have tight, narrowly focused beams. This is good for looking down long passageways and into cracks and crevices, and makes it possible to use a primary light as a signaling device—a critical part of cavern and cave diving.
- Can be used while running reels and spools: The most common primary lights for cavern and cave diving are worn using a glove mount or what is known as a Goodman handle. This leaves the hands free for working with reels and spools.

### Backup lights

Backup lights provide illumination for exiting the cavern following primary light failure. A backup light will typically have a rated output of at least _200 lumens or more_.

It is not unusual to have backup lights powered by the same type of battery used in primary lights. This can yield high output coupled with long burn times.

Some cavern and cave divers mount primary or backup lights on helmets. This allows hands-free operation—but it also means you can blind a buddy simply by looking at him. It also makes signaling with lights difficult. Do not permanently attach your only primary light to a helmet.

Many lights come with wrist lanyards. These make it impossible to work with reels and spools. For cavern diving, remove the lanyards and replace them with stainless bolt snaps.

## Attachment Hardware

As a cavern diver, you need a way to attach and carry:

- Lights
- Reels and spools
- SPGs or consoles

Any time one of these items is not in your hand, it must be attached or stowed where it will not likely be lost or cause entanglement.

Again, replace any lanyards that come with lights with stainless bolt snaps. Attach a stainless snap to your SPG or console so you can clip it to a harness D-ring when not in use.

### The ideal snap

The best type of snap for attaching lights, reels, spools and gauges must meet several criteria, including:

- Resistance to accidental opening or breakage.
- Ease of operation by touch or feel.
- Little likelihood of accidentally trapping line.

> The stainless steel bolt snap is ideal for cave and cavern use.

It is also called a dog leash snap. It opens by sliding a spring-loaded bolt.

Other types of snaps include carabiners and gate snaps. Although these are easier to operate than bolt snaps, cave and cavern divers should avoid them for two reasons:

- They can become stuck in the open position, leading to equipment loss.
- They have a greater tendency to accidentally trap guideline.
- Attaching snaps to lights and gauges
- The preferred method for attaching snaps to lights and gauges is to use several wraps of the same nylon guideline you find on your reels and spools and secure it with a square knot.

After tying the knot, cut off all but a short piece of line on each side. Then, using a lighter, melt the end of each line so that it forms a “mushroom” right next to the knot. This will help prevent the knot from opening accidentally.

> Do not attach snaps to lights and reels using plastic cable ties because cable ties break easily.

Ironically, it is for this very reason that some divers choose to use cable ties to attach snaps to items such as primary second stage. In the event of an emergency, they want to be able to break this connection quickly.

Do not attach snaps using stainless quick links or other metal hardware. Why? Because, in an entanglement situation, you can’t cut these free.

### Securing backup lights

The preferred method for carrying backup lights is to snap them to a shoulder D-ring and then secure the body of the light to the lower portion of your shoulder strap with a circle of bungee cord or similar elastic material.

Unfortunately, this may not work with sidemount or with some jacket-style sport-diving BCs. One alternative might be to attach the light to the upper portion of the shoulder strap. Alternately, you can stow a backup light in a BC or thigh pocket.

## Cutting Tools

In caverns and caves, you need a quick and reliable way to cut through guideline entanglement.

> The line cutter is the preferred cutting tool for cavern and cave diving.

These are often referred to as Z-knives. They evolved from the type of line cutter used by skydivers.

A typical line cutter for cavern and cave diving will consist of a razor blade inside a protective plastic or metal hook. It may have some sort of handle but still be smaller in size than most dive knives.

Line cutters can be carried on wrist straps, chest straps or harness waistbands. It’s common for cavern and cave divers to also carry a backup cutting device. This can be a second line cutter or a set of trauma shears carried in a sheath or stowed in a pocket.

Cave and cavern divers are advised not to carry large dive knives, especially those sheathed and worn on the lower leg. Knives like this were once popular but are impractical and pose an entanglement hazard when worn on the leg.

## Line Markers

Cave divers use line markers for a variety of reasons, including indicating the direction of the closest exit and marking popular intersections, also called jumps. In cavern diving, line markers are used primarily in emergency situations.

> Line markers fall into one of two categories: directional and non-directional.

[!image](/img/86.jpg)

Line arrows are directional markers. These arrowhead-shaped markers are intended to always point to the closest exit. Never put a line arrow on a line unless you are certain it points to the closest exit.

Non-directional markers come in a variety of shapes. The most common is the cookie. It has guideline slots like a line arrow, but rather than being shaped like an arrowhead, it is a round disk. Another common non-directional marker is the reference marker.

Non-directional markers are to be used when you are either unsure of the direction of the exit, or don’t want to convey directional information to others.

## Chapter 6 Summary

- Cavern diving teams must carry at least one primary reel per team and one safety reel or spool per diver.
- Because cavern divers dive during daylight hours and remain within clear sight of the entrance, the sun counts as the primary source of light for cavern diving.
- The stainless steel bolt snap is ideal for cave and cavern use.
- The line cutter is the preferred cutting tool for cavern and cave diving.
- Line markers fall into one of two categories: directional and non-directional.

# Chapter 7: Planning

Every cave diving plan includes six components that also apply to most cavern dives. These are:

- Sequence
- Air
- Depth
- Time
- Distance
- Direction

## Sequence

A tenet of cavern and cave diving is that we stay together. We do not leave a teammate behind. Cave and cavern divers plan for and adhere to a predefined sequence:

- The first diver in is the team leader. He or she is responsible for installing and retrieving the reel. The team leader is the first diver in and the last diver out.
- The last diver in brings up the rear going in, but leads the way going out.
- If there is a third diver in the team, that diver remains in the middle both entering and exiting.

On simple, linear (in-and-out along the same route) dives, when cave divers “call” the dive, each team member maintains his or her position, turning in place so that the last person in now leads the way out.

- Cavern diving differs from cave diving in that cave divers spend the vast majority of their time either entering or exiting. They remain in the pre-planned sequence the entire time.
- In contrast, cavern divers will typically run their reel into the cavern, tie off near the back of the cavern, then either explore in the immediate vicinity of the reel, or back and forth along the guideline. At some point, they may untie the reel and move it to another point in the cavern.

> Any time a team is in motion, either entering or exiting the cavern, team members must remain in sequence, the same as cave divers.

This is especially important in poor visibility, where failure to remain in sequence can result in leaving a team member behind. It falls to the team leader to ensure that he or she never “pulls” a reel without first making sure that every team member is present and accounted for and is exiting the cavern ahead of the team leader.

## Air

Cave divers adhere to the principle that, at any point during the dive, each diver needs to have twice the gas he or she theoretically needs to exit.

> Cavern divers follow the same principle as cave divers, keeping at least two-thirds of their starting gas volume in reserve to exit the cavern.

## Depth

In most instances, you will know the maximum depth of the cavern you are entering before the dive. As long as that depth is within normal cavern diving limits, and the training and experience of each team member, no problem. However,

> If the depth of the cavern exceeds the limits of any team member, your plan must include a maximum allowable depth, which no team member will exceed.

Depth will also impact your allowable No-Decompression Limit (NDL). In most instances, cavern divers have little difficulty staying well within NDLs. Remember: Every cavern dive must be a no-decompression dive.

## Time

In most instances, it is likely you and your team members will be exiting the cavern well before nearing your no-deco limit, but no-deco time may become an issue in deeper caverns.

> If the depth of the cavern increases the possibility of exceeding a no-decompression limit, you must include a time limit as part of your dive plan.

Again, every cavern dive must be a no-decompression dive.

## Distance

The general standard of practice for cavern diving is to limit penetration to 60 m/200 ft. This is measured from the surface, rather than from the cavern entrance.

In most caverns, you can’t exceed this distance without either hitting a wall or losing sight of the entrance. There are, however, caverns that are so large you can exceed this limit and still have the entrance clearly in sight.

> If a cavern is so large that there is a risk of accidentally exceeding the maximum penetration distance for cavern diving, your plan must include a landmark that team members agree they will not go past.

## Direction

In smaller caverns, this may not be an issue. There will be only one way in and one direction you can go. Larger caverns, however, may have multiple entrances and/or a choice of which direction you can go after entering.

> In caverns of a certain size, your dive plan may need to include which entrance you will use and which route you will follow after entering.

## The Golden Rule of Cavern Diving

Although not generally listed as part of your dive plan, there is an implied limitation included in every cavern or cave dive:

> Any team member can “call” any dive, at any time and for any reason.

Each team member must be assured he or she can terminate a dive at any time without being overruled or criticized by fellow team members.

## Chapter 7 Summary

- Any time the team is in motion, either entering or exiting the cavern, they need to remain in sequence, the same as cave divers.
- Cavern divers follow the same principle as cave divers, keeping at least two-thirds of their starting gas volume in reserve to exit the cavern.
- If the depth of the cavern exceeds the limits of any team member, your plan must include a maximum allowable depth, which no team member will exceed.
- If the depth of the cavern increases the possibility of exceeding a no-decompression limit, you must include a time limit as part of your dive plan.
- If a cavern is so large that there is a risk of accidentally exceeding the maximum penetration distance for cavern diving, your plan must include a landmark that team members agree they will not go past.
- In caverns of a certain size, your dive plan may need to include which entrance you will use and which route you will follow after entering.
- Any team member can “call” any dive, at any time and for any reason.

# Chapter 8: Gas Management

While cavern and cave divers can experience any number of problems while diving, the one true emergency is being suddenly without gas to breathe. This is why gas management is the most important aspect of dive planning.

Here we’ll look at how you can prevent out-of-air emergencies through proper dive planning.

## Terminology

Throughout this chapter, we use three terms. These are:

- Usable gas: The volume of gas any team member can use before it’s time to terminate the dive and head for the exit.
- Turnaround point: A value determined by subtracting usable gas from actual starting volume.
- Controlling diver: The controlling diver is the one with the least actual starting gas volume. He or she will be the one that determines the usable gas for both himself and his buddy or team.

## Thirds: It’s for Cavern Divers Too

The “Rule of Thirds” calls for cave divers to use one-third of their gas supply for entering and exploring, one-third for exiting, and leave one-third remaining in reserve for emergencies. No matter where they are in the cave and what they are doing, they plan to have twice as much gas in reserve as they theoretically need to exit the cave.

Why do cavern divers need to adhere to this rule? After all, cavern divers are supposed to remain within 60 m/200 ft of the surface. The gas need to cover this distance wouldn’t be that much, right?

The problem is the amount of gas needed to swim out from your maximum point of penetration makes no allowances for the time needed to:

- Search for a lost teammate
- Find a lost guideline
- Deal with entanglement or entrapment
- Make a safety stop

While you can estimate the amount of gas needed to simply swim out of the cavern, there is no way to predict how much gas you would need to solve any of the problems listed above.

> The best approach is to adhere to the Rule of Thirds or a more conservative plan.

## Simple Turnaround Calulations

Turnaround calculations have the potential to be exceedingly complex. Whenever possible, it makes sense to keep them as simple as possible.

### When you can “keep it simple”

There are two situations in which individual team members diving open circuit can do their own gas turnaround calculations, independent of other team members. These are:

- Sidemount divers: If all team members are on sidemount, they can calculate their turnaround pressure independent of other team members. Why? Because, should they have a problem with one sidemount cylinder, they should be able to easily exit the cavern with the gas in the remaining cylinder.
- Teams of three: Teams of three are considered the ideal cavern and cave diving team because, should one member suffer a catastrophic loss of gas, there will be two potential donors.

Sample Rule of Thirds calculations

When you can calculate your turnaround pressure independent of other team members, doing so becomes relatively easy. The steps are:

- If your starting cylinder pressure is not already a number easily divisible by three, round it down to the next value that is.
- Divide the rounded-down number by three. The result is your usable gas.
- Subtract your usable gas value from your actual starting pressure. The result will be your turnaround pressure.

[!image](/img/099.jpg)

Remember:

> The single biggest mistake divers make when calculating turnaround pressures is that they subtract their usable gas value from the rounded-down number, rather than from their actual starting pressure.

Let’s look at some examples:

Metric example: We’ll assume your starting pressure is 190 bar.

- 190 is not easily divisible by three, so you round down to a value that is: 180 bar.
- One-third of 180, or 60 bar, is your usable gas.
- By deducting 60 from your actual starting pressure of 190 bar, you get a turnaround pressure of 130 bar.

Imperial example: We’ll assume your staring pressure is 2,900 psi.

- As 2,900 is not easily divisible by three, you round down to a value that is: 2,700 psi.
- One-third of 2700, or 900 psi, is your usable gas.
- By deducting 900 from your actual starting pressure of 2,900 psi, you get a turnaround pressure of 2,000 psi.

## Simple Gas Matching

The term gas matching refers to what you do when members of a buddy team have significantly differing starting gas volumes. An example would be when one diver is using a single cylinder while his or her buddy uses doubles.

Let’s assume both divers begin a dive with the same starting pressure, follow the Rule of Thirds and hit their turnaround pressure simultaneously. At this point:

- The diver in doubles has more than sufficient gas to get both himself and his buddy out of the cavern.
- The diver in the single does not. In fact, he’s not even close.

To deal with this, cavern divers can use the gas matching technique to establish the safest possible turnaround points.

> When both buddies are using the same size cylinders, gas matching is only slightly more complex than it is when divers determine turnaround pressures independently of their teammates.

The procedure is:

- Start by identifying the controlling diver. As both divers are using the same size cylinder, this would be the diver with the lowest starting pressure.
- The controlling diver then determines his usable gas as outlined above.
- At this point, both divers subtract the controlling diver’s usable gas from their actual starting pressures to determine their individual turnaround pressures.

**Metric example**: Francois is starting the dive with 240 bar; his buddy, Heinrich, has 170 bar, which makes Heinrich the controlling diver.

- Following the procedure outlined above, Heinrich determines that his usable gas is one-third of 150 bar, or 50 bar.
- At this point, both divers subtract Heinrich’s usable gas from their actual starting pressure. This gives Francois a turnaround pressure of 190 bar and Heinrich a turnaround pressure of 120 bar.

What this means is that, at any point, either diver (theoretically) has sufficient gas to get himself and his buddy out of the cavern.

**Imperial example**: Bob is starting the dive with 3,300 psi; his buddy, Justin, has 2,800 psi, which makes Justin the controlling diver.

- Following the procedure outlined above, Justin determines that his usable gas is one-third of 2,700 psi, or 900 psi.
- At this point, both divers subtract Justin’s usable gas from their actual starting pressure. This gives Bob a turnaround pressure of 2,400 psi and Justin a turnaround pressure of 1,900 psi.

Again, this means that, at any point, either diver (theoretically) has sufficient gas to get himself and his buddy out of the cavern.

## Dissimilar Cylinders

Turnaround calculations can get complicated when teammates are using dissimilar cylinders—especially when using Imperial units of measure instead of metric. When buddies are using cylinders of different capacities, you can no longer base your turnaround calculations solely on starting pressure.

If you want your calculations to be precise, you must account for the fact that the same pressure in two dissimilar cylinders does not mean the cylinders are of equal volume.

The procedure is largely the same as before, with a few wrinkles:

- Identify the controlling diver: This may not be the same as the diver with the lowest starting pressure, if that diver is using a substantially larger cylinder. You will need to do some math or look up values on a table.
- The controlling diver determines his or her usable gas: This part is largely the same as before.
- The non-controlling buddy converts this value to an equivalent pressure in his or her cylinder: More math required.

Each team member subtracts his or her unique usable gas value from his or her actual starting pressure: This is the easy part.

**Metric example**: Francois is using a single 15-liter cylinder and is starting the dive with 160 bar. His buddy, Heinrich, is using a single 12-liter cylinder filled to 180 bar.

- To determine who is the controlling diver, each diver multiplies his cylinder capacity by his starting pressure in bar.
- With a little over 2,100 liters to his partner’s 2,400 liters, Heinrich is the controlling diver—despite having the higher starting pressure.
- Heinrich determines that his usable gas is one-third of 180 bar, or 60 bar. Multiplying 60 bar by 12 liters, this value also represents 720 liters of equivalent surface gas.
- Francois determines that 720 liters is represented by 48 bar, making this his usable gas.
- Each diver subtracts his usable gas value from his actual starting pressure. This makes Francois’ turnaround pressure 112 bar and Heinrich’s 120 bar.

If this seems complex, check out the calculation using Imperial measurements.

**Imperial example**: Bob is using a single high pressure 120 cubic foot cylinder and is starting the dive with 2,400 psi. His buddy, Dustin, is using a single high pressure 80-cubic foot cylinder filled to 3,300 psi.

- To determine who the controlling diver is, each diver consults the table appearing in the Appendix.
- With 77 cubic feet to his partner’s 84 cubic feet, Dustin is the controlling diver—despite having the higher starting pressure.
- Dustin determines that his usable gas is one-third of 3,300 psi, or 1,100 psi. According to the table, this value also represents 26 cubic feet of gas.
- Bob determines that in his cylinder, 26 cubic feet is represented by 700 psi, making this his usable gas.
- Each diver subtracts his usable gas value from his actual starting pressure. This makes Bob’s turnaround pressure 1,700 psi and Dustin’s 2,200 psi.

## Gas Matching for Cavern Diving

At this point, you may be thinking, Is it really this complicated? It depends on whom you ask.

- Some believe precise gas matching calculations are essential for all overhead-environment diving, even in caverns.
- Others believe doing so makes things overly complicated, given the limited penetration distances associated with diving in caverns.

Who is right? Consider the following:

- Precise gas turnaround calculations can’t always be done prior to entering the water. If your cylinders have been sitting out in the hot sun, or lying overnight in near-freezing conditions, you may find your actual starting pressure changes by as much as 20 bar or 300 psi once your tanks adjust to water temperature. You won’t know for sure until you have been in the water for several minutes. For this reason, final turnaround calculations should be done after all other pre-dive checks are completed.
- Dissimilar cylinder calculations require that you either have an equivalent volume table handy or you use a baseline multiplier value, which requires the ability to accurately multiply and divide.
- When you factor in all the variables that come into play in a gas-sharing situation, many people believe that a disparity in starting volumes is only significant if it exceeds 15 to 20 percent or more. And that’s in caves, not caverns.
- In cavern diving, we are primarily concerned with having sufficient reserve gas to solve problems such as being lost, entrapment or entanglement. As you read earlier in the chapter, the amount of gas required to simply exit the cavern is comparatively small—even if sharing gas with another diver.

Given these factors, what should you do? Consider this:

> Many divers believe complex gas calculations are not necessary for cavern diving.

They assert that by using the Rule of Thirds calculation, cavern divers should have more than sufficient gas to deal with contingencies. There is no evidence to the contrary. Remember, this is only for cavern diving, not cave diving.

You must decide which set of limits you want to follow. No one can do this for you.

## Chapter 8 Summary

- Always keep at least two-thirds of your starting gas volume in reserve to solve problems and then exit the cavern.
- The single biggest mistake divers make when calculating turn pressures is that they subtract their usable gas value from the rounded-down number rather than from their actual starting pressure.
- When both buddies are using the same size cylinders, gas matching is only slightly more complex than it is when divers determine turn pressures independently of their teammates.
- If you want your calculations to be precise when using dissimilar cylinders, you have to account for the fact that the same pressure in two dissimilar cylinders does not mean the cylinders are of equal volume.
- Some divers believe complex gas calculations aren’t necessary for cavern diving.

# Chapter 9: Pre-dive Checks

Adequate preparation prevents problems. Here we’ll use a simple acronym, START—S-Drill, Team, Air, Route and Tables—for conducting a thorough in-water pre-dive check.

## S-Drill

The “S” in S-Drill stands for safety. While there are many problems that can occur underwater, there is only one real emergency. You must be prepared for this. It is best to make this preparation part of your pre-dive check—a step called the Safety Drill or S-Drill.

Being suddenly without breathing gas is the most dangerous underwater situation. Performing the S-Drill will prepare you to safely handle a gas-sharing emergency.

How to handle a loss of breathing gas depends on your equipment configuration.

- Sidemount divers can likely manage their own loss of breathing gas by switching to the remaining cylinder and terminating the dive. They might, however, need to act as a donor for a non-sidemount buddy on open circuit.
- Divers in backmounted doubles are more likely to experience a free-flowing regulator or damaged manifold than a total loss of breathing gas. This is why it’s important to begin every dive by making sure each valve is turned all the way on. This ensures the isolator is open and gas is flowing to both regulators.

Prior to each dive in the Cavern Diver course, you may be instructed to practice gas sharing in shallow water. Practicing this skill is beneficial because:

- It helps ensure that each diver’s long hose is readily deployable and not caught under straps or other equipment.
- It helps build muscle memory associated with quickly passing a second stage while keeping it right-side up.
- It helps teammates become familiar with each other’s gear.

Large regulator mouthpieces may trigger a gag reflex in some divers—which further complicates a gas-sharing emergency. For this reason, compact mouthpieces are preferred over larger ones.

However, you choose to conduct an S-Drill, it’s important to make sure your primary second stage is deployable and that all other team members are comfortable breathing from it.

Some S-drills include a bubble check. We’ll cover this in the next section.

## Team

Team sequence should always be the first element in your dive plan. Go over it again so that there are no misunderstandings.

The Team portion of START includes reviewing team sequence and visually inspecting one another to eliminate potential problems.

Ensuring that every piece of equipment is in place and ready to go is an important part of any pre-dive check. While you can check many equipment items yourself, it is important to have a teammate give you a thorough head-to-toe visual inspection.

- Check for twisted straps, hoses trapped under harness webbing, dangling gear or anything else that could cause problems later on.
- Make sure you know how your buddy’s long hose deploys and what it would take to get them out of their harness and other equipment in an emergency.
- Conduct a bubble check. In this exercise, you and your teammate submerge and check each other’s gas-delivery system for leaks.
- Inspect valves, manifolds, regulators, and any items that are prone to leakage. If you detect leaks, get out of the water and fix them before proceeding.

## Air

While you may have done a preliminary projection of what each team member’s turnaround pressure will be, remember this:

> You can only determine accurate gas turnaround points after you have been in the water long enough for your cylinders to adjust to ambient temperature.

Calculating and reviewing each team member’s turnaround pressure is a critical part of the final in-water check.

## Route

The R in START stands for Route.

> If elements such as Distance and Direction have been part of your original dive plan, you need to review them in the water before starting your dive.

Again, this is more likely to come into play when diving larger caverns, possibly with multiple entry and exit points.

## Tables

The final T in START stands for Tables. Most likely not literal dive tables but rather Depth and Time.

> If Depth and Time values are important enough to be part of your original dive plan, review them before starting the dive.

This is most likely to happen in caverns with depths exceeding 20 m/65 ft.

## Chapter 9 Summary

- Being suddenly without breathing gas is the most dangerous underwater situation. Performing the S-Drill will prepare you to safely handle a gas-sharing emergency.
- The Team portion of START includes reviewing team sequence and visually inspecting one another to eliminate potential problems.
- You can only determine accurate gas turnaround points after you have been in the water long enough for your cylinders to adjust to ambient temperature.
- If elements such as Distance and Direction have been part of your original dive plan, you need to review them in the water before starting your dive.
- If Depth and Time values are important enough to be part of your original dive plan, you need to also review them before starting the dive.

# Chapter 10: Buoyancy, Trim and Propulsion

If you ask most divers what sets cavern and cave divers apart from most others, you are likely to hear “excellent buoyancy control and trim.” This is because buoyancy and trim have a direct bearing on visibility and, thus, safety.

You will also hear people talk about the propulsion techniques cavern and cave divers use. The standard flutter kick entry-level divers learn does not work well in caverns and caves. It tends to disturb silt and can lead to environmental damage.

We will cover both of these issues in this chapter.

## The Importance of Buoyancy and Trim

This course places emphasis on perfecting buoyancy control and trim. Why?

- Buoyancy and trim are keys to preserving good visibility and protecting a fragile environment.
- We know this is true for every form of diving, but it is especially true of cavern and cave diving.

Loss of visibility can be a contributing factor in accidents.

With few exceptions, divers in caverns and caves must maintain neutral buoyancy. Maintaining neutral buoyancy takes precedence over most other tasks, such as running reels and guidelines.

### Trim

The ideal body position for cavern diving is to have your knees and shoulders in line with one another, on the same horizontal plane.

[!image](/img/124.jpg)

Your feet and fins should be above this horizontal plane. The benefits of maintaining good body position include:

- Improved streamlining
- Efficient movement
- Avoiding guideline entanglement

Problems with maintaining ideal body position may be resolved by adjusting or repositioning equipment. This often includes redistributing your weights.

## Modified Flutter Kick

Sport divers are often taught to keep their knees and ankles straight when performing the flutter kick. Cave and cavern divers use a modified flutter kick.

> The modified flutter kick used in cave and cavern diving involves kicking with bent knees and ankles and keeping the feet/fins above the plane of the body.

[!image](/img/125.jpg)

The modified flutter kick is easy to master and is useful in moderate- or low-flow conditions.

## Frog Kick

Another popular kick used by cavern and cave divers is the frog kick.

> The frog kick is similar to the swimming motion used by a frog.

[!image](/img/126.jpg)

The frog kick is a good anti-silting technique. However, it is not recommended when near fragile formations. When swimming long distances, alternate between the frog kick and modified flutter kick to avoid cramping.

## Pulling

The third popular propulsion technique is pulling, which is also referred to as pull and glide.

> Pulling on strategically selected handholds may be the only effective way to move when in high-flow conditions.

This technique is recommended when in small areas, regardless of flow, to avoid fin contact with the walls, floor and ceiling. When you are pulling, your feet and legs should remain still.

As a rule, when pulling, use handholds already used by others. The idea is to leave as much of the cavern untouched as possible.

## Chapter 10 Summary

- Buoyancy and trim are keys to preserving good visibility and protecting a fragile environment.
- The modified flutter kick used in cave and cavern diving involves kicking with bent knees and ankles along with keeping the feet/fins above the plane of the body.
- The frog kick is similar to the swimming motion used by a frog.
- Pulling on strategically selected handholds may be the only effective way to move when in high-flow conditions.

# Chapter 11: Guideline and Reel Use

Maintaining a continuous guideline to open water is the most important rule you must follow when exploring overhead environments. Guideline and reel use are among the most important skills you learn in the Cavern Diver course.

This chapter covers the use of guidelines and reels, including:

- General principles that apply to any type of guideline and reel use in caverns and caves.
- Making primary and secondary tie-offs at the cavern entrance.
- Running reels inside caverns.

## General Principles of Guideline and Reel Use

These include:

- Buoyancy control comes first. Don’t allow running the reel or interacting with teammates to distract you from maintaining proper buoyancy. If necessary, stop and reestablish buoyancy control before continuing with the reel.
  > Maintaining neutral buoyancy takes precedence over operating a guideline.
- Keep the guideline taut (stretched tight) at all times. Maintaining tension on the guideline helps prevent guideline entanglement.
- If the guideline becomes slack, stop and tighten it before continuing. Avoid kicking while reeling in line as you exit a cavern. Instead, use the reel to pull yourself out. This will help keep the guideline taut.
- Do not hold the reel by the handle unless you have a finger on the spool or a hand on the crank. When tying off, hold the reel by the spool and not by the handle. This will help prevent the spool from turning freely.

[!image](/img/128.jpg)

- Visualize reel orientation. The guideline must always face the cavern entrance. When reeling into the cave, the guide (guideline opening) should point behind you. When reeling out of the cave, the guide should point in front of you.

Running reels is a team effort.

> The team leader is responsible for running the reel. The second team member plays an equally important role.

Buddies can help by:

- Providing illumination for the team leader as needed.
- Pulling tie-offs for the team leader on the way out, if possible.
- Not pulling placements on the way out, as this may cause the line to go slack.
- Staying well out in front of a team leader who is reeling out in high-flow conditions. This is so the team leader won’t have to constantly stop to avoid running into you, which might cause the line to go slack.
- Keeping your hands off the guideline and staying out of the way.

Think of others when running reels and spools.

- Do not place guidelines in a manner that poses an entanglement risk to other teams. Use placements as needed to keep your guideline low to the floor and out of the way of others.
- Do not use another team’s tie-offs and placements or cross another team’s line. If you must cross another team’s line, do so underneath so they will have less difficulty pulling their line.
- Run your line so that other teams may run their line parallel to yours (don’t zigzag your line back and forth across the passageway).

## Making Primary and Secondary Tie-Offs

Unless there are permanent guidelines in place and the landowner or government entity controlling the site prohibits you from running your own reels, always begin every cavern dive by making primary and secondary tie-offs.

### Choosing where to tie off

The ideal place to make a primary tie-off is in open water, just outside the cavern entrance, at a point where you can make a direct, uninterrupted ascent to breathable air. Do this whenever possible.

At some sites, there may be no secure and reliable tie-off points in open water. You may find safer and better tie-off points located at or just inside the cavern entrance.
Consider the risk your guideline may pose to others.

- Many cavern diving sites are also frequented by swimmers, snorkelers and open-water scuba divers. Take care that your guideline does not pose an entanglement risk to a swimmer or snorkeler.
- You also don’t want to create what is known as an attractive nuisance that might entice a freediver or open-water diver to venture into an overhead environment. When this is a possibility, set your guideline discreetly.

> Your primary and secondary tie-offs must be safe and secure—and not pose a risk to others.

### The ideal tie-off point

Your primary tie-off point will likely be either a rock formation or fallen log at the bottom of the basin. The best tie-off points share the following characteristics:

- They are either firmly attached to the bottom or are too large and heavy to be easily moved.
- They are no wider in diameter than a telephone pole.
- The most ideal rock formation for tie offs resembles a fist—wider above the wrist, narrower along the arm. Make your tie off just below the wrist and it will be less likely to slip off.

### How to tie off

A tie off consists of two wraps around a solid object. Open-ended objects make the best tie-off points, because you can easily remove or “pull” it at the end of the dive.

[!image](/img/130.jpg)

Secondary tie-offs serve as a backup to the primary tie-off and are usually made just inside the cave entrance. Secondary tie-offs consist of two wraps and a locking loop.

[!image](/img/131.jpg)

After making your primary and secondary tie-offs, avoid making any others. Other than these initial tie offs, control the guideline by using placements (tucking or placing the line next to an object, as opposed to wrapping an object), as these “pull” themselves as you exit.

## Reel Use Inside Caverns

Your primary and secondary tie-offs are made. Now what do you do? This depends on the shape and size of the cavern.

- In smaller caverns, you may do little more than run your reel to the back of the cavern, tie off, then spend your time either exploring in the immediate vicinity of the reel, or back and forth along the guideline.
- In larger caverns, you may first run the reel to one part of the cavern, then later untie it and move to a different part of the cavern to explore further.

[!image](/img/132.jpg)

Do not sweep your guideline back and forth across the width of the cavern. Doing so could cause you to cross other teams’ lines, snare other divers or accidentally pull the reel away from one of your own team members.

> The number one rule of reel use inside caverns is that you never “pull” the reel and exit the cavern before first making sure all your teammates are present and accounted for. They are to exit the cavern ahead of you.

Pulling a reel before confirming that teammates have exited has contributed to fatal accidents involving cavern divers.

## Chapter 11 Summary

- Maintaining neutral buoyancy takes precedence over operating a guideline.
- The team leader is responsible for running the reel. The second team member plays an equally important role.
- Your primary and secondary tie-offs must be safe and secure—and not pose a risk to others.
- The number one rule of reel use inside caverns is that you never “pull” the reel and exit the cavern before making sure all your teammates are present and accounted for. They are to exit the cavern ahead of you.

# Chapter 12: Communication

Good communication among team members is critical to safe cavern diving. Cavern divers rely on three types of signals:

- Command signals
- Light signals
- Hand signals

Command signals are usually just a special type of hand signal, although there is one which divers generally make using lights. We’ll cover these first before mentioning other means of communication.

## Command Signals

Command signals are the first tier of communication in cavern and cave diving.

Every team member must respond to command signals in a specific way.
Abort the dive if a team member does not or cannot respond appropriately.

[!image](/img/133.jpg)

These signals include:

### Okay? Okay!

Just as in open water, this signal can be both a question and an answer. Once any team member uses this signal to pose it as a question, every other team member must confirm that he or she either is okay, or explain why he or she is not. Any response other than Okay generally means it is time to “call” the dive.

Cavern and cave divers often use lights to communicate the Okay signal, unless they are already facing one another. In a three-person team, if the diver in the middle receives an Okay signal from a diver on either side, he or she first checks with the remaining diver before signaling back that both are okay.

### Hold!

Any team member can use this signal (a closed fist) to have other team members stop and hold in place. Once a team member gives this signal, the other team members must give the Hold signal in response to indicate they understand they are not to move.

When the situation that first caused a team member to initiate the Hold signal is resolved, that team member signals Okay. At this point, the other team members respond with Okay signals, and the dive continues.

### Surface

This signal (an upward pointing thumb, as in open water) means that the dive is over, and all team members are to exit in sequence. As with all command signals, the other team members must give the Surface signal in response to the team member who initiated it, to indicate they understand the dive is over.

## Lights

Light signals are the second tier of communication in cavern and cave diving.

> Light signals are among the easiest and most efficient to use.

Cavern diving lights should have tightly focused, narrow beams. This facilitates signaling.

[!image](/img/134.jpg)

Commonly used light signals (beyond the Okay signal) include:

### Attention

A slow, back-and-forth movement in any direction.

### Emergency

A rapid, back-and-forth movement in any direction.

## Hand Signals

Most of the same hand signals used in open water apply to cavern and cave diving. There are, however, some hand signals that are unique to diving in overhead environments.

To use hand signals, divers must first be facing one another. This may involve using the Attention light signal so that everyone in the team looks in the direction of the signaler.

[!image](/img/135.jpg)

Hand signals involving the use of crossed fingers pertain to the use of guidelines and reels. These signals convey messages such as reel out, tie off, entanglement and cut the line. Other common hand signals include:

### Silt

Indicated by rubbing the thumb and fingers together. This signal is most often used to tell another team member that he or she is causing a silt-out.

### Question?

Indicated by curving the index finger like a question mark and followed by other signals to explain the nature of the question. For example, Question: Am I bubbling?

### Bubbles

Indicated by bouncing the index finger off the tip of the thumb. This signal is most often used to ask a fellow team member whether your regulator or valves are leaking, or to tell a fellow team member that his or her regulator or valves are leaking.

### Backup Light On

Backup lights can come on accidentally during a dive (your instructor will tell you how to avoid this). The backup light signal (fingers flashing like rays of light) can be used to tell a fellow team member that his or her backup light has come on.

### Which Way?

Indicated by pointing the thumb from side to side, this signal asks, which way do we go?

### Slow Down

To tell fellow team members to slow down, move your forearm up and down, with your palm spread flat and pointing downward.

## Other Means of Communication

Where there is a need to communicate information that light and hand signals cannot, divers can use slates or wet notes.

> If divers must resort to using slates or wet notes to communicate with one another it may indicate a situation that dictates terminating the dive.

Another means of communication is called touch-contact communication. This is an emergency procedure covered in the Problem Management section.

## Chapter 12 Summary

- Every team member must respond to command signals in a specific way.
- Light signals are among the easiest and most efficient to use.
- To use hand signals, divers must first be facing one another. This may involve using the Attention light signal so that everyone in the team looks in the direction of the signaler.
- If divers must resort to using slates or wet notes to communicate with one another it may indicate a situation that dictates terminating the dive.

# Chapter 13: Panic and Stress

- We start by discussing panic, which can contribute to fatalities in underwater caverns and caves.
- We then examine several sources of physiological and psychological stress, including the cumulative effect of too much stress.

### Panic

Panic is a sudden response to fear, stress, pain or other stimuli associated with danger that is strong enough to prevent logical thinking and rational action. Panic can prove fatal to divers in caverns and caves.

> The only reliable way to overcome panic is to prevent it from occurring in the first place.

Effective ways to prevent panic include:

- Thorough planning
- Pre-dive visualization
- Clear communication
- Overlearning skill
- Early recognition and management of stress

## Stress

A certain amount of stress can be beneficial, provided it prevents complacency and keeps you alert. Too much stress, however, causes problems.

Stress can be physiological or psychological, or both. Recognizing and quickly responding to stress is the key to preventing problems.

Let’s take a look at stressors common to cavern and cave diving.

### Physiological Stress

Sources of physiological stress can include:

- Cold: Cold can lead to discomfort, degradation of motor skills and perceptual narrowing. This is why adequate thermal protection is vital.
- Exertion: Exhausted divers tend not to think clearly. They may even succumb to the fear that they will not be able to “keep up” and, thus, be left behind. Avoid exhaustion by pacing yourself and by signaling team members to Slow Down if necessary.
- Illness: Dive only when feeling well. Never be afraid to cancel or abort a dive if you feel ill.
- Injury: Physical pain reduces a diver’s ability to focus and can cause anxiety.
- Poorly fitting equipment: Ill-fitting gear is a distraction that can prove dangerous.
- Narcosis: Diving beyond the safe operational limits of your breathing gas can contribute to fatal accidents. Narcosis inhibits rational thinking and behavior.

### Psychological Stress

Sources of psychological stress can include:

- Time pressure: Cavern and cave divers have limited breathing gas supplies, meaning they also have limited time for resolving problems. This can cause time stress.
- Peer pressure: Peer pressure happens when well-meaning buddies insist a diver makes a dive when he or she isn’t up for it. Do not succumb to peer pressure and avoid pressuring others into diving.
- Self-doubt: Lack of confidence in your scuba training, experience and ability can impair your judgment and cause you to act in unsafe ways.
- Equipment not working perfectly: Improperly functioning gear is distracting and dangerous. Regular, professional equipment maintenance is important.
- Difficulty performing skills: Difficulty performing routine tasks can cause self-doubt that leads to panic.
- Task loading: The accumulation of psychological and/or physiological stressors can trigger panic.

## Chapter 13 Summary

- The only reliable way to overcome panic is to prevent it from occurring in the first place.
- Sources of stress can be physiological or psychological, or both. Recognizing and quickly responding to stress is key to preventing problems.

# Chapter 14: Problem Solving

There are three problems cavern and cave divers may encounter that are more annoying than life threatening. However, if you fail to respond to them correctly, they could cause stress and, ultimately, panic.

Here’s how to deal with them.

## Jammed Reels

Few things in cavern diving are more frustrating than a jammed reel.

> It is not a matter of whether you will ever jam a reel, but simply when.

With practice, you may be able to unjam a reel underwater. However, do not spend more than a minute or two attempting to do so. Be aware that loose guideline poses an entanglement risk to you and your teammates.

If you are unable to unjam the reel within a minute or two, exit the cavern by wrapping the guideline around the outside of the locked-down reel.

## Light Failure

Should your primary light fail:

- Immediately activate your backup light
- Signal buddies
- End the dive

> If switching to a backup light, remember to activate it before unclipping it. This will enable you to find the light if you accidentally drop it.

When exiting the cavern, put the affected diver in front, where other team members will have no difficulty seeing his or her weaker backup light.

## Loss of Visibility

If the visibility drops to the point where you risk losing sight of the guideline, abort the dive.

Avoid silt-outs by using good buoyancy control and proper kicking technique. If you encounter a low-visibility situation beyond your control, exit the cavern before it becomes serious.

If visibility becomes so bad you risk losing the guideline, make and maintain physical contact with it. The procedure is to make a locked-finger Okay around the line, wait for your teammates to join you, then exit the cavern.

It is essential to maintain team cohesion while exiting in zero or near-zero visibility. There are two methods for maintaining team cohesion in zero or near-zero visibility: bump-and-go and touch-contact.

### Bump-and-Go

This is a natural extension of what happens when visibility gradually worsens, then improves.

- The lead diver stops every 5-10 m/15-30 ft and waits for the next team member to “bump” him from behind. Keep one hand on the guideline and one hand outstretched.
- Upon being “bumped” by the following diver, the lead diver then swims ahead another 5-10 m/15-30 ft.
- If necessary, the second diver waits to be “bumped” by the third team member before continuing.
- Communication, if needed, can be accomplished using the same signals as discussed next under touch-contact.

### Touch-Contact

The touch-contact method allows team members to remain in physical contact with one another at all times.

- It starts by having all team members grasp the guideline with the same hand (right or left).
- The team member in the rear then uses his free hand to grasp the diver ahead of him.
- The lead diver keeps his or her free arm extended to avoid bumping into things.

There are a number of special touch-contact signals divers need to know how to use, including:

- Go
- Stop (Hold)
- I’m stuck/entangled
- Emergency
- Share air
- We need to cross the line

The line-crossing procedure associated with touch-contact is something your instructor will cover during the land drill portion of the course and you will practice both on land and in water.

The chief benefit of touch-contact is that it allows team members to be in constant contact with one another. Drawbacks of the touch-contact method include:

- It is complicated and time consuming (at a time when you really want to move).
- It increases the potential for further silting.
- It is not well suited for narrow passageways or places where the guideline zigzags from side to side (requiring repeated line crossings).

Nevertheless, touch-contact may be preferable in situations where divers do not want to lose contact with one another, however briefly.

## Chapter 14 Summary

- Reel jams are common. It is not a matter of whether you will ever jam a reel, but simply when.
- When switching to a backup light, remember to activate it before unclipping it. This will enable you to find the light if you accidentally drop it.
- Avoid silt-outs by using good buoyancy control and proper kicking technique. If you encounter a low-visibility situation beyond your control, exit the cavern before it becomes serious.

# Chapter 15: Serious Problems

Here we discuss problems that are potentially life threatening.

While all of these problems are serious, total loss of breathing gas is immediately life threatening.

## Lost Diver

If you discover that a team member is missing, and you have not yet hit your turnaround pressure, you can look for him or her. Before you begin your search, follow these steps:

- Stop and think. Acting in haste leads to mistakes.
- Check your SPG. Make sure you are still within the limit of Thirds.
- Cover your light. This may enable you to see your missing buddy’s light in the distance.

Do not turn your light off. The switch is the part of the dive light most likely to fail. If you turn your light off, you risk it failing. Instead, cover the light with your hand or hold the lens against your body.

Assuming you still don’t see the missing diver:

- Go to where you tied off your reel. If you have not yet tied off the reel, use the closest available tie-off point to do so. This will mark the place at which you realized your teammate was missing.
- Using the tie off as a starting point, use your reel to search in the direction you think the missing diver headed.
- As you search, do not exceed the limits of your training. Stay above 40 m/130 ft, be within 60 m/200 ft of air and keep the cavern entrance in sight at all times.
- If you don’t immediately find the missing diver, try searching in a different direction.

You will likely find your missing teammate quickly. If you can’t locate him or her after a short search, exit the cavern and get help.

> If you must exit the cavern before locating a lost teammate, leave your reel and guideline in place for the missing diver to find.

## Lost Guidelines

Should you find yourself with no guideline in sight, the first thing you must do is Stop. Doing so helps ensure you won’t become even more lost. Next:

- Sweep your light to look for your buddies or the guideline.
- Cover your light to try and locate your teammates’ lights or the exit.

You will likely see either your buddies, the guideline or the cavern entrance.

- If you see your buddies, swim to them.
- If you don’t see your buddies, but see the guideline, swim to it.
- If you don’t see your buddies or the guideline, but see the exit, swim to it.
- If you remain lost after looking for one minute, leave your present location and continue searching for your buddies, the guideline or the exit.
- If lost off the guideline, the single most important thing you can do is tie off your safety reel or spool so that, should you not find your buddies, the guideline or the exit, you can return to your starting point and be no more lost than before.

Tie off to the closest secure formation. If none is available, turn your backup light on, tie off to the backup light and bury it in the mud as an anchor.

You might be searching in zero or near-zero visibility so, as you do:

- Sweep your free hand up and down between the floor and as high up as you can reach. You may feel the lost guideline this way before you ever see it. Try to avoid stirring up more silt.
- You may miss the guideline by passing under it. If you hit a wall, try moving up and back across the ceiling; there is a good possibility you may snare the guideline you are seeking with your reel.
- If you are not successful in finding the guideline on your first attempt, return to your starting point and try a different direction.

Assuming you do find the guideline, do not be tempted to go back and retrieve your safety reel or spool. As you will likely have buddies who are searching for you, lock down and wrap your safety reel/spool (which should be marked with your initials) around the guideline, but snap the clip to the guideline you found in the direction you intend to travel.

> Never hesitate to leave reels or spools behind in bad visibility. You can always go back and get them when the visibility clears.

## Entanglement and Entrapment

These are different, yet similar problems. If you get stuck:

- Get your teammates’ attention immediately—even if you think you can free yourself. This way, if you need assistance, it won’t be too late to signal your buddies.
- Remember the entanglement signal: Crossed fingers moving in a Figure 8.
- Don’t struggle. Make no more than one attempt to free yourself, then just relax and let your teammates free you.

> When entangled or entrapped, it is often best to just relax and let your buddies free you.

## Regulator, Valve or Manifold Failure

There are a number of potential problems here, including:

- A free-flowing regulator
- A damaged or leaking manifold or H-valve
- A valve roll off

Although a failure of any of these items is not likely to cause an immediate loss of breathing gas, failure to respond immediately to the problem can result in loss of breathing gas in a matter of minutes.

Dealing with regulator, valve or manifold failure may require the assistance of a teammate—which is why buddy awareness is so important when diving in overhead environments.

### Regulator Free Flow

The correct response here will depend on whether you have just a single regulator first stage, or two first stages on a set of sidemount cylinders, a dual-orifice manifold or an H-valve.

If you have just a single first stage, there isn’t much you can do to stop the leakage. Although you could likely make it to the exit before exhausting your remaining gas, why take chances? Get on a buddy’s alternate-air-source and exit together.

- If you have two first stages, and one is free flowing from its second stage, simply reach back and turn off the gas supply to the affected second stage, switch to the other second stage and exit the cavern.
- Manifold or H-valve Damaged or Leaking

This can include a failed regulator-to-valve connection, a failed burst disk or tank-neck o-ring, a burst hose or damage to the valve or manifold itself. The problem here is that it’s all happening behind you, making it difficult to determine exactly what the problem is and how to solve it.

This is why we dive with buddies. In this situation, a buddy can:

- Identify the problem.
- Shut down the valve that will keep gas loss to a minimum.

> Your buddy can also tell you which second stage to breathe from on the way out.

If diving sidemount, you can obviously manage this sort of problem yourself, secure in the knowledge that the unaffected cylinder has more than sufficient gas to get you out of the cavern.

### Valve Roll Off

This is a problem chiefly associated with dual-orifice manifolds — but it can happen with other configurations. With manifolds, frequent contact with the ceiling can cause the left-hand turn wheel to roll to the off position. And, because divers generally breathe from the regulator on the right-hand post, the fact it has rolled off may not be immediately apparent.

Still, there are warning signs, including:

- A pressure gauge needle that does not move.
- Loss of gas flow to a BC or dry suit inflator hose connected to the left post regulator.

Responding to this problem is easy. Simply reach back and turn the affected valve back on again—a skill you should practice at the beginning of each dive. However, prevention is a better problem solver.

## Total Loss of Gas

It is unlikely that a diver who regularly monitors his or her pressure gauge will simply run out of air without warning. More likely causes of loss of breathing gas include:

- Lost mouthpiece.
- Isolator accidentally closed, draining one side of doubles prematurely.
- Failure to respond quickly or correctly to manifold/valve failure.
- Being the first buddy to run out of air after the team becomes lost or separated.

Loss of breathing gas is the only true cavern and cave diving emergency. This is a critical situation requiring an immediate response.

In some instances, total loss of breathing gas can be addressed simply by switching to the non-affected second stage. Examples include:

- Lost mouthpiece.
- Isolator accidentally closed.

If switching second stages will not solve the problem, immediate buddy assistance is required.

- The affected diver signals Attention!/Out of Air!
- The donor must quickly pass his long-hose second stage. Make sure the second stage is passed right side up, with the purge button unblocked.
- Once the second stage is passed, deploy the full length of the long hose.
- The receiver should generally take up a position in front of the donor, holding on to the regulator hose with one hand to help prevent it from accidentally being pulled from his mouth.
- Assuming good visibility, the donor should hold onto the receiver by the upper arm, thus enabling the donor to signal using the touch-contact protocols.
- If visibility remains good, there is no need to slow the exit down by maintaining physical contact with the guideline.

In zero or near-zero visibility, and assuming the donor has passed a 1.5 m/5.0 ft or longer hose, there is a variation on touch-contact that will still enable divers to exit quickly, while causing minimal silting.

- The receiver Okays the guideline using the same hand with which he is holding on to the donor’s long hose.
- The donor takes up a position immediately behind the receiver and also Okays the guideline with one hand.
- Because the divers are physically connected by the long hose, there is no reason for the donor to hold on to the receiver’s arm to prevent buddy separation.
- Touch-contact signals can be exchanged as needed, by reaching out and touching the receiver’s leg.
- In this position, there is also no need to go through a complex, time-consuming process to cross guidelines. The receiver simply moves the long hose and guideline back and forth from one hand to the other as needed and the donor follows suit.

If using a standard sport-diving regulator, with a comparatively short alternate-air-source hose, your options are more limited. You will most likely need to take up a position on either side of the guideline. Fortunately, as a cavern diver you should not have passed through any restrictions and should have little difficulty exiting.

## Chapter 15 Summary

- If you need to exit the cavern before locating a lost teammate, leave your reel and guideline in place for the missing diver to find.
- If lost off the guideline, the single most important thing you can do is tie off your safety reel or spool so that, should you not find your buddies, the guideline or the exit, you can return to your starting point and be no more lost than before.
- When entangled or entrapped it is often best to just relax and let your buddies free you.
- How you deal with regulator, valve or manifold failure may require the assistance of a teammate—which is why buddy awareness is so important when diving in overhead environments.
- Loss of breathing gas is the only true cavern and cave diving emergency. This is a critical situation requiring an immediate response.

# Chapter 16: Lack of a Continuous Guideline to Open Water

Underwater caverns and caves are generally not comprised of a single, easy to follow conduit. Instead, they are often a maze of interconnecting tunnels. Seldom does the way out resemble the way in.

Additionally, the presence of an easily disturbed layer of silt can reduce visibility, making it difficult to see the cavern exit.

> A continuous guideline secured to the cavern or cave entrance allows divers to safely find their way out regardless of factors such as reduced visibility.

In many overhead-environment fatalities, the divers had sufficient breathing gas to exit from their maximum point of penetration; however, without a continuous guideline they failed to find the exit before running out of breathing gas.

## Gas Management Errors

as management errors have caused divers to run out of breathing gas before reaching the exit. Cavern and cave diving requires gas management practices different from open-water diving.

To have sufficient breathing gas to exit the cavern or cave, divers must keep at least two-thirds of their starting gas supply in reserve.
This is known as the Rule of Thirds.

### Exceeding the Limits of the Breathing Mixture

Simply stated, what you breathe can kill you.

> Exceeding the safe operational limits of the breathing mixture can be fatal.

This typically involves diving below 40 meters/130 feet on air, where factors such as nitrogen narcosis, carbon dioxide build-up, oxygen toxicity and rapid gas consumption can all contribute to diver fatalities.

## Lack of Specialized Training

While most cavern or cave diving fatalities result from one or more of the three direct causes outlined previously, there are also two contributing causes that can lead to a cavern diving fatality. The first of these is lack of specialized training.

> A significant number of cavern or cave diving fatalities involve those who had no training in overhead-environment diving.

Divers who lack this training will not have the knowledge, experience and skills necessary to avoid the three direct causes of cavern and cave diver fatalities.

Investigations of fatalities involving certified cavern or cave divers indicate that exceeding the limits of their training was a contributing factor.

## Insufficient Number of Lights

Modern dive lights are highly reliable but can still fail. Loss of light means loss of visibility.

> Failure to carry an adequate number of lights is identified as a contributing factor in the deaths of divers who also lacked formal cavern or cave diver training.

Trained cavern and cave divers know they must have at least three sources of light per person.

- Cave divers carry at least one primary and two backup lights.
- Cavern divers carry at least two lights.

Because cavern divers remain within sight of daylight, the sun counts as the primary light source.

## The Five Rules of Accident Avoidance

The three direct and two contributing causes of cavern and cave diver fatalities make up the Five Rules of Accident Avoidance. There are:

1. Be trained and certified for cavern or cave diving and remain within the limits of your training and experience.
1. Maintain a continuous guideline leading to the cavern or cave entrance.
1. Remain within the safe operating (depth) limits of your breathing mixture.
1. Keep at least two-thirds of your starting gas supply in reserve to exit.
1. Have at least three sources of light per diver.

## Chapter 16 Summary

- A continuous guideline secured to the cavern or cave entrance allows divers to safely find their way out.
- To have sufficient breathing gas to exit a cavern or cave, divers must keep at least two-thirds of their starting gas supply in reserve.
- Exceeding the safe operational limits of your breathing mixture can prove fatal.
- A significant number of cave or cavern diver fatalities involve those who had no formal training in overhead-environment diving.
- Failure to carry an adequate number of lights is identified as a contributing factor in the deaths of divers who also lacked formal cavern or cave diver training.

# Chapter 16: Continuing Education

A good diver never stops learning. As you complete your Cavern Diver course, it’s normal to ask, What’s next? Here are some suggestions.

## Scuba Diving International (SDI)

SDI is the sport-diving arm of International Training. There are several SDI courses that every serious cavern diver should consider.

### Advanced Adventure

Additional training past entry-level helps you get more out of any Specialty Diver course. Cavern Diver is no exception. The SDI Advanced Adventure course provides an introduction to Deep Diving and Underwater Navigation, plus three more specialties of your choosing.

### Computer Nitrox

Nitrox can extend your available bottom time. There is a good possibility your potential cavern diving buddies will all be certified to use nitrox, and they will be looking for teammates whose available bottom time matches their own.

The SDI version of the Nitrox Diver course emphasizes the use of personal dive computers to track both oxygen and nitrogen exposure. As such, it is simple and easy to understand.

### Rescue Diver

The SDI Rescue Diver Course is designed to develop the knowledge and necessary skills to effectively perform diver rescues and assist and administer the necessary first aid in the event of an emergency. You will learn skills such as how to perform self-rescue, buddy rescues, recognize and calm potential panicked divers, administer proper first aid to divers that have experienced dive-related injuries, conduct effective search patterns and manage accident scenes.

## Technical Diving International (TDI)

If you are reading this, you are no doubt already familiar with TDI, the world’s leading technical diver training organization. Your opportunities for training as a TDI Diver include additional courses designed to advance your Cavern Diver skills.

### Sidemount Diver

Sidemount is the configuration of choice for an increasing number of overhead-environment divers. Developed for cave divers and optimized for cave diving, it’s the course many divers take prior to or in conjunction with Cavern and Cave Diver training.

### Intro to Tech

Many instructors teach the Intro to Tech course in combination with Cavern Diver. The skills overlap, but the knowledge goes well beyond Cavern Diver in terms of preparing students for further technical training.

### Intro to Cave

This is the next step past Cavern Diver for students looking to progress to Full Cave Diver certification. Emphasis is on making limited penetrations along the main line while staying within the no-decompression limits.

### Full Cave

This course is the third stage of overhead-environment training in the series of TDI’s Full Cave Diver Development Program. Advanced cave dive planning, practical execution of different types of cave systems and scenarios divers encounter are presented.

### TDI Nitrox

The TDI Nitrox Diver course is perfect for those wanting a more comprehensive introduction to nitrox diving. It covers using Equivalent Air Depths (EADs) in conjunction with dive tables, and tracking “CNS Clock” exposures.

### Advanced Nitrox

For even more comprehensive Nitrox Diver training, the TDI Advanced Nitrox course covers the use of nitrox mixtures with oxygen concentrations up to and including pure oxygen. It should be considered an important prerequisite for students planning to take CCR or Decompression Procedures training.

### Decompression Procedures

Diving at the Full Cave Diver level invariably involves decompression. For this reason, many Full Cave students take both the Advanced Nitrox and Deco Procedures courses either before or in conjunction with Full Cave Diver.

By themselves, Advanced Nitrox and Deco Procedures can help prepare you for activities such as deep ocean wreck diving and other non-overhead technical diving activities.

### Advanced Wreck Diver

This course involves limited wreck penetration. The Cavern Diver course can meet one of its prerequisites.

## Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI)

ERDI is a Public Safety Diving (PSD) agency that trains police, fire, and other public safety organizations in search and rescue techniques that apply to almost any submerged environment. ERDI trains departments on how to make and maintain PSD teams and is the only public safety dive training agency that has its own insurance and endorses its own standards. In fact, some of the largest, most successful and renowned public safety departments use ERDI training programs to conduct training.
