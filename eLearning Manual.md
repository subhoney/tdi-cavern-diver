# Chapter 1: Introduction

In this chapter, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What is an overhead environment?
- What is cavern diving?
- Why take Cavern Diver training?
- What can you expect during your Cavern Diver course?

## What Is An Overhead Environment?

An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.

## What is Cavern Diving?

Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within sight of the entrance.

Any time divers venture beyond sight of the cavern entrance, they are cave diving and not cavern diving. And, when the sun goes down, every cavern is considered a cave.

Cavern diving differs from cave diving in the following ways:

Cavern diving requires little more than standard single-tank, sport-diving equipment. Cave diving requires highly specialized equipment, such as backmount or sidemount doubles.
divers_gearing_up

TDI Full Cave Diver certification requires a minimum of six or more days of training and 16 or more dives. TDI Cavern Diver certification requires as little as two days of training and four dives.

Cave diving is a form of technical diving that takes divers beyond accepted sport-diving limits. Cavern diving takes place within normal sport-diving depth and time limits.

## Cavern Diver Training Benefits

Why take part in TDI Cavern Diver training?

> The benefits of Cavern Diver training go beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.

- Cavern diving helps divers develop exceptional buoyancy control and trim.
- It helps divers streamline their equipment to avoid entanglement and improve overall function.
- It introduces advanced dive planning procedures used by technical divers. In fact, the Cavern Diver course closely parallels the TDI Intro to Tech Diver course.
- It is the first step in a process that can lead to TDI Introductory Cave Diver and Full Cave Diver certification. It is also a good precursor to Advanced Wreck Diver training.

## About the Cavern Diver Course

The TDI Cavern Diver course consists of:

- Self-study
- Academic review
- Guideline and emergency skill practice on dry land
- Guideline and emergency skill practice in shallow water
- Several cavern dives

The Cavern Diver course emphasizes the importance of pre-planning and gas management when exploring overhead environments. Why?

> When diving in open water, divers generally can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an overhead obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

## Chapter 1: Summary

- An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.
- Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within direct sight of the entrance.
- The benefits inherent in taking Cavern Diver training goes beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.
- When diving in open water, divers can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

# Chapter 2: Land

## Landowner Relations and Conservation

To be able to go cavern diving, we first need a place to dive. This can only happen if:

- Landowners grant permission to dive.
- We protect the fragile cavern environment so it’s worth diving there.

Here, we’ll discuss the diver’s responsibility in landowner relations and conservation.

### Landowner Relations

When dealing with the individuals, organizations and government entities that either own the land on which the caverns and caves you dive are located, or own the land that provides access to these sites, remember these two key points:

- There is no unowned land.
- Our access depends on following the rules.
- There is no unowned land.

Do not assume that undeveloped, unfenced or unposted land “doesn’t really belong to anyone.” It does—and regardless of whether the owner is an individual, business or organization, or a government agency, the owner has the right to allow or deny access to the property.

Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.

This goes beyond just avoiding arrest for trespassing. Future access to the site may depend on cavern and cave divers gaining a reputation as people who respect property rights.

**Our access depends on following the rules.**

Most popular underwater caverns and caves are located in government controlled or privately operated parks and recreation sites. These sites typically have and enforce various rules applying to divers of different training and experience levels.

> Understand and follow all rules in effect at dive sites.

Your willingness to follow the rules may determine if you and others are allowed future access to popular sites.

## Cavern and Cave Conservation

Underwater caverns and caves are fragile environments that must be treated with respect and care.

To avoid damaging a cavern or cave site: **Match the site to your skill level.**

Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.

Use the right propulsion technique. The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

Remember that any damage you cause to the fragile cavern/cave environment will be visible forever. Fragile stone formations and speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) take tens of thousands of years to form. Once damaged they will not grow back.

Even something as seemingly innocuous as a hand or fin print in a bed of clay can remain visible beyond our lifetimes. The only possible way to deal with such damage is to prevent it.

## Chapter 2: Summary

- Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.
- Understand and follow the rules at the dive site.
- Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.
- The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

# Chapter 3: Cave Type and Formation

The more you know about the environment in which you dive, the more you will appreciate and enjoy the experience. This is as true of caverns as it is of coral reefs.

In this chapter, we answer the following questions:

- What are the different types of caves and caverns?
- How do solution caves and caverns form?

## Cave Types

There are at least four different cavern and cave types.

The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes and solution caves.

Let’s take a look at what makes each type unique.

### Coral caves

Coral caves typically form when the tops of adjacent coral reefs grow together, forming tunnels and arches. They are common along the edges of walls and drop-offs.

### Sea caves

Formed by wave action eroding limestone or other soft rock, sea caves tend to penetrate the cliffs in which they form for only a short distance. During all but the highest tides, the ceilings of most sea caves are open to air.

### Lava tubes

A byproduct of volcanic eruptions, lava tubes form when the outside of a lava flow cools and hardens, while the interior remains molten. If the lava flow abruptly terminates, the molten core may empty out, leaving a hollow conduit.

### Solution caves

These form when the carbonic acid present in groundwater dissolves soft rock, such as limestone or dolomite. Solution caves often form a series of complex, maze-like passageways.

Most caverns and caves are found in karst topography, which is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and gypsum.

## Karst Topography

_(Note: This section inserted by me. -Ed.)_

**Karst topography** is a distinctive type of landscape formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, primarily limestone, dolomite, and gypsum.

### Key Characteristics

- **Formation:** Created when slightly acidic water (from rain or groundwater) dissolves carbonate bedrock over thousands of years
- **Surface features:** Sinkholes, disappearing streams, springs, and irregular rocky terrain
- **Underground features:** Extensive cave systems, underground rivers, and caverns

### Relevance to Cave Diving

Karst topography is directly responsible for creating the cave systems that divers explore. Florida, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and many other popular cave diving destinations are karst regions where this geological process has created vast underwater cave networks.

The dissolution process creates:

- **Cenotes** (Mexico) - natural sinkholes providing access to underwater caves
- **Springs** (Florida) - outlets where underground water emerges
- **Cave passages** - dissolved conduits through the limestone

This geological feature is fundamental to understanding why caves exist in certain regions and how they continue to evolve over time.

## Solution Cave Formation

Most karst terrain is nothing but layer upon layer of limestone, or calcium carbonate, covered with a thin layer of sand and clay. Limestone is a highly porous rock; the limestone in most karst regions is especially porous. Water moves easily between the loosely compacted particles and shells that comprise most of this rock.

When rain falls on karst terrain, the ground absorbs it almost immediately. Before it is absorbed, the rainwater acquires carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and the decaying organic matter it passes through. When combined with the hydrogen and oxygen in water (H2O), the carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid (H2CO3).

[!image](/img/027.jpg)

The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.

[!image](/img/028.jpg)

One example of this solution process is called spongework. This occurs when carbonic acid dissolves pockets of softer limestone, leaving rock that resembles Swiss cheese.

[!image](/img/029.jpg)

When rain falls on highly porous karst terrain, it is absorbed into the ground, saturating the limestone below.

[!image](/img/030.jpg)

Rivers passing through the region often have water levels lower than the surrounding water table. Gravity creates a tendency for water to move sideways through the rock as the water tries to run downhill.

[!image](/img/031.jpg)

Ground water seeks the path of least resistance. This can include bedding planes (the boundary between limestone layers), fractures in the rock and even interconnecting spongework. As this takes place, the carbonic acid works to further dissolve these conduits.

When passage diameter exceeds nine centimeters, the rate of dissolution accelerates. Thus, the biggest conduits for water flow tend to become even bigger over time. Eventually, these can form an interconnecting maze of cave passageways.

[!image](/img/032.jpg)

Mature cave systems may surface in a spring basin, away from the river, and connect to the river by a spring run.

## Cavern and Cave Entrance Types

Cavern and cave entrances may be either springs or siphons. A sinkhole or karst window may have both.

Springs exist where water flows out of the ground. Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.

Siphons form in one of two ways.

[!image](/img/33.jpg)

If the level of adjacent rivers rises above that of the water table, karst openings that are normally springs may temporarily siphon.

[!image](/img/34.jpg)

The development of sinkholes over underground rivers often creates openings with a spring on one side and a siphon on the other.

Diving springs is almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

The opposite is true for siphons. Additionally, divers entering siphons may experience substantially lower visibility than divers entering springs—especially in areas where siphons ingest tannic-stained water from adjacent rivers.

## Chapter 3 Summary

- The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes, and solution caves.
- The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.
- Springs exist where water flows out of the ground.
- Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.
- Diving springs are almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort, and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

# Chapter 4: Environmental Risks

Now that you know where underwater caverns and caves come from, it’s time to talk about the risks associated with diving them. To do this, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What are the risks associated with diving overhead environments?
- Why do siphons pose a greater risk than springs?
- What can cause loss of visibility and why is it a problem?
- What are restrictions and why should you avoid them?
- What are line traps and why should you avoid them?

## Overhead Environments

Aquatic environments can pose many risks for divers, the greatest of which is being out of breathing gas while underwater.

> Divers in open water almost always have the ability to make a direct ascent to the surface.

A direct ascent to the surface is not possible when cavern diving.

## Loss of Visibility

Why be concerned with maintaining good visibility?

> Loss of visibility can trigger more serious problems.

They include:

- Disorientation and confusion.
- Buddy separation and impeded communication.
- Losing sight of the guideline or exit.
- Substantially slower exit times; especially if divers need to spend time locating the guideline, the exit, or each other.

Loss of visibility can be caused by:

- Poor starting visibility.
- Siphoning.
- Disturbance of silts and sediments.

### Poor starting visibility

If the visibility inside a cavern is poor when entering, it will not likely improve. On the other hand, if you start in good visibility, a slight decrease in overall visibility is not likely to be a problem.

#### Siphoning

Siphons can suck in dark, tannic-laden river water or algae from an adjacent open-water basin. This can severely lower visibility.

#### Silt

Given good starting visibility, the greatest risk of loss of visibility comes from the disturbance of silt. Silt is a broad term that actually describes a range of sediments.

[!image](/img/38.jpg)

_(Note: I have only included this graphic because I think it's hilarious. -Ed.)_

- At one end of the continuum is sand. While easily disturbed, it drops out of suspension almost immediately.
- At the other end of the continuum is clay. While harder to disturb, once you do so it can take up to 24 hours or more to settle.

The best way to handle silting problems is to avoid them.

- Silt is common in areas with low flow, so be aware of water movement—or lack of it—in caverns.
- Pay attention to the bottom composition and learn to distinguish between sand, mud and clay.

To avoid or reduce silting, perfect your buoyancy control, trim and propulsion techniques.

## Siphons

Avoid siphons whenever possible, because:

> Siphons are often associated with poor visibility. Siphoning can make it difficult or impossible to exit a cavern.

Diving a siphon requires more time, energy and breathing gas to exit a cavern than you used when entering.
A mild siphon near the cavern entrance can turn into an overpowering one farther in. This poses an entrapment risk. The best way to deal with siphons is to avoid them.

## Restrictions

Among the limits of Cavern Diver training is a prohibition against passing through restrictions.

> A restriction is a passage or opening too narrow for divers to pass through side by side.

[!image](/img/40.jpg)

Negotiating restrictions, including air-sharing while passing through a restriction, requires specialized training that is not a part of Cavern Diver training. Minor restrictions are covered in the TDI Intro Cave and TDI Full Cave courses.

## Line Traps

Line traps are openings into which divers may accidentally pull the guideline but are too narrow for the divers to pass through.

[!image](/img/41.jpg)

> Line traps are dangerous because they prevent divers from exiting the cavern using the guideline. The ability to follow a guideline is critically important in low visibility.

When running reels, check behind you frequently to ensure your guideline has not fallen into a line trap.

## Chapter 4 Summary

- Divers in open water almost always have the ability to make a direct ascent to the surface. A direct ascent is not possible when cavern diving.
- Loss of visibility can trigger serious problems including disorientation and confusion, buddy separation and impeded communication, losing sight of the guideline or exit, and slower exit times.
- Siphons are often associated with poor visibility. Siphoning can make it difficult or impossible to exit a cavern.
- A restriction is a passage or opening too narrow for divers to pass through side by side.
- Line traps are dangerous because they prevent divers from exiting the cavern using the guideline. The ability to follow a guideline is critically important in low visibility.

# Chapter 5: Equipment

In this course we will determine if your current open-water gear is suitable for cavern diving and, if so, what modifications may be required before using it in overhead environments.

Equipment used for single-cylinder diving in open water can be modified for cavern diving. Specialized equipment including backmount or sidemount double cylinders or closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) can also be used for cavern diving.

If you intend to use backmount or sidemount doubles during the Cavern Diver course, you must already be properly trained to do so.

> Cavern diving equipment must meet specific objectives.

These objectives include:

- Securing or removing any dangling equipment that could cause entanglement, disturb silt or damage fragile cave formations.
- Eliminating unnecessary accessory items.
- Making critical equipment items instantly accessible by feel.
- Equipping for a streamlined and properly trimmed body position in the water.

## Mask, Snorkel, and Fins

The mask and fins you already own will likely be suitable for cavern diving.

### Masks and Snorkels

> Nearly any mask that fits well is suitable for cavern diving.

Snorkels are not used for cavern diving because they are an entanglement risk and are useless in overhead environments.

Most cave and technical divers carry a backup mask that can be stowed in a pocket.

### Fins

Only open-heel scuba fins are adequate for cavern diving. They must be designed to allow specialized propulsion techniques used by cavern divers to avoid silting.

Split and hinged fins generally do not work well when doing the frog kick, helicopter turn, or modified flutter kick used by cavern divers to avoid silting.

#### Avoiding strap problems

Loose or dangling straps are a guideline entanglement hazard.

> Mask and fins straps must be secured.

Before easily adjustable, quick-release fin strap buckles were developed, cavern and cave divers taped the loose ends of fin straps so that they could not snare the guideline. This isn’t necessary with most modern fins.

A better alternative is to use spring or elastic heel straps. These are standard on most technical diving fins and available as an after-market accessory for most others.

A good way to rid your mask of loose strap ends is to replace it with a neoprene strap that has no loose ends. Another approach is to wear your mask strap under your hood. Doing this also helps prevent mask loss.

## Exposure Suits

Hypothermia is a potentially dangerous drop in body temperature usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Choosing the right exposure protection is important.

Factors to consider when selecting exposure protection include surface temperature, water temperature, length of exposure and depth.

A full-length exposure suit is essential in nearly all cavern environments. This is typically a 5-mm or thicker wetsuit. As temperatures drop below 24° C/75? F, a dry suit might be a better option.

### Exposure suit accessories

Hoods: A well-fitting hood is an important exposure protection accessory.

Thigh pockets: BC and harness-mounted pockets tend to have limited capacity and may be hard to access. Thigh pockets found on most dry suits have greater capacity and are easier to use. You can easily add thigh pockets to most wetsuits.

## Regulators

Here we will discuss using a normal sport-diving regulator attached to a single cylinder.

If using a single regulator first stage, it must be capable of supplying gas to two divers at depth.

A gas-sharing situation at depth puts considerable demand on a first stage.

## Alternate-Air-Source Configuration

A conventional sport-diving regulator system can be easily modified for cavern diving. It usually features:

- A short primary second stage hose.
- A slightly longer alternate-air-source second stage hose.
- An equally long high-pressure hose ending in an instrument console.

The sport-diving equipment configuration shown here has inherent drawbacks for cavern use, including:

- The longer alternate-air-source second stage can be harder to locate and pass quickly to an out-of-air diver.
- It is easy to accidentally pass the alternate upside down, which can cause the recipient to inhale water, adding to panic.
- As usually configured, the alternate-air-source hose presents a snagging risk.
- Although you can use a conventional alternate-air-source second stage for cavern diving, consider switching to a primary second stage with a long hose for gas sharing.

The equipment configuration shown here offers several benefits, including:

- It allows you to pass the primary second stage to a distressed diver, allowing you to initiate gas sharing faster.
- Your natural wrist motion when passing a primary second stage tends to keep it right-side up.
- While many conventional “octopus” second stages are not designed for ease of breathing, your primary second stage should offer excellent performance. This is exactly what an out-of-gas diver needs.
- Because your backup second stage is worn on a necklace, it stays within easy reach.

This configuration is streamlined and reduces the risk of snagged hoses.

Inflator hoses that feature integrated regulators, which also suppose a potential donor will be passing his or her primary second stage, offer many of the same benefits. However, if not secured properly, the inflator hose may present an entanglement risk.

## BC Air Cell, Harness and Weight System

Cavern divers must equip and train to avoid silting.

> Your buoyancy compensator (BC) air cell, harness and weight system must be configured to help you maintain proper horizontal trim.

Modern weight-integrated BCs, especially those with trim weight pockets located on the upper portion of the BC, are preferred over traditional weight belts worn on the waist because the weights can be distributed along your body’s natural balance point.

Many students use the Cavern Diver course as an opportunity to switch to a harness and air cell system commonly used by cavern and cave divers. The benefits of these systems include:

- The back-mounted air cell may help in maintaining proper trim. Users can switch to air cells of different sizes.
- Modular systems make it possible to reposition D-rings or add accessories such as weight pockets.
- Many modular systems allow the same harness to be adapted for use with doubles or sidemount.

If your ultimate goal is to progress to cave or tech diver training, consider investing in a modular harness and air cell system.

## Instrumentation

Just as in open water, your dive data must be readily accessible when cavern diving.

Your instrumentation needs to include a means of monitoring depth, time, no-decompression status and cylinder pressure.

Minimum instrumentation for cavern diving includes:

- A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) calibrated in either 10-bar or 100-psi increments. This is crucial for dive planning and gas management.
- A means of monitoring both depth and time, such as a dive computer or depth gauge and timer.

Additionally:

- If you have a gas-integrated dive computer that reads cylinder pressure, plan to back it up with a mechanical gauge.
- Do not rely on a single means of monitoring depth, time, and no-decompression status. This means equipping with a backup dive computer or dive tables.
- Instruments such as thermometers and compasses have little value in cavern diving.
- All equipment must be attached securely to the diver’s BC or harness. Dangling gear is an entanglement hazard.

Most cave and technical divers avoid using a multi-gauge instrument console, relying instead on a mechanical SPG on a relatively short high-pressure hose. They use wrist-mounted dive computers and depth gauge/timers.

## Chapter 5 Summary

- Cavern diving equipment must meet specific objectives.
- Nearly any mask used for open-water diving is suitable for cavern diving.
- Mask and fin straps must be secured to prevent possible snagging.
- Snorkels are not used for cavern diving because they are an entanglement risk and are useless in overhead environments.
- Factors to consider when selecting exposure protection include surface temperature, water temperature, length of exposure and depth.
- If using a single regulator first stage, it must be capable of supplying gas to two divers at depth.
- Although you can use a conventional alternate-air-source second stage for cavern diving, consider switching to a primary second stage with a long hose for gas sharing.
- Your BC air cell, harness and weight system must be configured to help you maintain proper horizontal trim.
- Your instrumentation needs to include a means of monitoring depth, time, no-decompression status and cylinder pressure.

# Chapter 6: Specialized Equipment for Cavern Diving

As a cavern diver, you will use several items that are not normally part of sport diving in open water, including:

- Reels and spools for backup navigation in case you lose sight of the exit.
- Primary and backup lights to ensure you are never without a light source to augment sunlight entering the cavern.
- Attachment hardware to prevent items such as lights and reels from becoming lost or causing damage.
- Cutting tools in case of entanglement.
- Line markers, which are useful in missing diver scenarios.

Let’s take a look at each of these.

## Reels and Spools

Cave divers primarily navigate using permanent guidelines installed in the cave, while cavern divers generally do not.

- Cave divers use reels and spools to make temporary connections between permanent guidelines and the cave entrance or other guidelines.
- Cavern divers typically use a single temporary guideline connecting them with the cavern entrance.
- Some dive sites, such as those used for guided cavern dives, have lines permanently installed so that temporary guidelines are not needed.

### Reels and spools: what’s the difference?

A spool is a cylindrical device onto which line can be wound. A reel is a spool with additional features, including:

- An axle
- A winding knob
- A lockdown screw or mechanism
- A frame
- A handle
- An attachment clip

[!image](/img/65.jpg)

Reels are typically larger than spools. Some reel designs feature a handle on top. Newer designs tend to have a side-mounted handle.

[!image](/img/66.jpg)

Spools consist of just the spool itself, coupled with a double-ended snap used for carrying the spool and clipping it off.

- Compared with spools of the same capacity, reels are larger and heavier. They cannot be stowed in pockets and must be carried externally, clipped off to D-rings.
- Reels are slightly more difficult to use than spools.

The biggest drawback of reels is that they can jam. A jammed reel can be difficult to fix while underwater.

[!image](/img/67.jpg)

- Spools are compact and can fit into pockets, reducing the risk of loss or entanglement.
- Spools are easier to use and require less practice.
- The biggest advantage of spools is that, with the exception of “bird’s nesting”—line piling up on one side of the spool—they are almost impossible to jam.

Still, conventional reels are often preferred over spools for two reasons:

- Using a spool to wind up more than a few meters/feet of guideline can cause wrist strain. This is why most cavern divers use spools only to cover short distances or for use in place of a safety reel to eliminate the risk of a reel jamming.
- [!image](/img/68.jpg)
- The act of winding a guideline around a spool tends to put a twist in the line. After a few uses, you may need to unwind the spool, straighten the line, then rewind it.

Most cavern and cave divers use conventional reels for long distances and spools for short distances or in place of a safety reel.

### Reel and spool categories

Reels and spools generally fall into one of four categories:

[!image](/img/69.jpg)

- Exploration reels are the largest and capable of carrying several hundred meters/feet of guideline. These are used in the exploration and mapping of virgin caves.
- Primary reels typically carry 75-150 m/250-500 ft of guideline. Cave divers generally use them to connect a cave entrance to a permanent guideline or to explore off a permanent guideline. Cavern diving teams use them as their primary means of navigation.
- Safety reels and spools typically carry 40 m/125 ft or more of guideline. These are used in emergency situations, such as if divers become lost off the guideline.
- Jump reels and spools are used by cave divers to make temporary connections between permanent guideline. They come in a variety of sizes and will generally carry at least 6 m/20 ft of line. Cavern divers generally do not use them.

[!image](/img/70.jpg)

> Cavern diving teams must carry at least one primary reel per team and one safety reel or spool per diver.

## Lights

\_(Note: All images removed. They aren't helpful. -Ed.)

Each team member needs to have three light sources.

Because cavern divers dive during daylight hours and remain within clear sight of the entrance, the sun counts as the primary source of light for cavern diving.

### Primary dive lights

Your primary dive light is the one you use throughout the dive. Your backup light is used in the event of primary light failure.

What makes a light suitable as a primary light for cavern diving?

- Output: Select a primary light rated for 1,000 lumens or more. Your light’s output should be comparable with your teammates’ lights. A teammate using a significantly less powerful light risks accidentally being left behind because his or her buddies fail to notice their absence.
- Pattern: The best lights for cavern and cave diving have tight, narrowly focused beams. This is good for looking down long passageways and into cracks and crevices, and makes it possible to use a primary light as a signaling device—a critical part of cavern and cave diving.
- Can be used while running reels and spools: The most common primary lights for cavern and cave diving are worn using a glove mount or what is known as a Goodman handle. This leaves the hands free for working with reels and spools.

### Backup lights

Backup lights provide illumination for exiting the cavern following primary light failure. A backup light will typically have a rated output of at least _200 lumens or more_.

It is not unusual to have backup lights powered by the same type of battery used in primary lights. This can yield high output coupled with long burn times.

Some cavern and cave divers mount primary or backup lights on helmets. This allows hands-free operation—but it also means you can blind a buddy simply by looking at him. It also makes signaling with lights difficult. Do not permanently attach your only primary light to a helmet.

Many lights come with wrist lanyards. These make it impossible to work with reels and spools. For cavern diving, remove the lanyards and replace them with stainless bolt snaps.

## Attachment Hardware

As a cavern diver, you need a way to attach and carry:

- Lights
- Reels and spools
- SPGs or consoles

Any time one of these items is not in your hand, it must be attached or stowed where it will not likely be lost or cause entanglement.

Again, replace any lanyards that come with lights with stainless bolt snaps. Attach a stainless snap to your SPG or console so you can clip it to a harness D-ring when not in use.

### The ideal snap

The best type of snap for attaching lights, reels, spools and gauges must meet several criteria, including:

- Resistance to accidental opening or breakage.
- Ease of operation by touch or feel.
- Little likelihood of accidentally trapping line.

> The stainless steel bolt snap is ideal for cave and cavern use.

It is also called a dog leash snap. It opens by sliding a spring-loaded bolt.

Other types of snaps include carabiners and gate snaps. Although these are easier to operate than bolt snaps, cave and cavern divers should avoid them for two reasons:

- They can become stuck in the open position, leading to equipment loss.
- They have a greater tendency to accidentally trap guideline.
- Attaching snaps to lights and gauges
- The preferred method for attaching snaps to lights and gauges is to use several wraps of the same nylon guideline you find on your reels and spools and secure it with a square knot.

After tying the knot, cut off all but a short piece of line on each side. Then, using a lighter, melt the end of each line so that it forms a “mushroom” right next to the knot. This will help prevent the knot from opening accidentally.

> Do not attach snaps to lights and reels using plastic cable ties because cable ties break easily.

Ironically, it is for this very reason that some divers choose to use cable ties to attach snaps to items such as primary second stage. In the event of an emergency, they want to be able to break this connection quickly.

Do not attach snaps using stainless quick links or other metal hardware. Why? Because, in an entanglement situation, you can’t cut these free.

### Securing backup lights

The preferred method for carrying backup lights is to snap them to a shoulder D-ring and then secure the body of the light to the lower portion of your shoulder strap with a circle of bungee cord or similar elastic material.

Unfortunately, this may not work with sidemount or with some jacket-style sport-diving BCs. One alternative might be to attach the light to the upper portion of the shoulder strap. Alternately, you can stow a backup light in a BC or thigh pocket.

## Cutting Tools

In caverns and caves, you need a quick and reliable way to cut through guideline entanglement.

> The line cutter is the preferred cutting tool for cavern and cave diving.

These are often referred to as Z-knives. They evolved from the type of line cutter used by skydivers.

A typical line cutter for cavern and cave diving will consist of a razor blade inside a protective plastic or metal hook. It may have some sort of handle but still be smaller in size than most dive knives.

Line cutters can be carried on wrist straps, chest straps or harness waistbands. It’s common for cavern and cave divers to also carry a backup cutting device. This can be a second line cutter or a set of trauma shears carried in a sheath or stowed in a pocket.

Cave and cavern divers are advised not to carry large dive knives, especially those sheathed and worn on the lower leg. Knives like this were once popular but are impractical and pose an entanglement hazard when worn on the leg.

## Line Markers

Cave divers use line markers for a variety of reasons, including indicating the direction of the closest exit and marking popular intersections, also called jumps. In cavern diving, line markers are used primarily in emergency situations.

> Line markers fall into one of two categories: directional and non-directional.

[!image](/img/86.jpg)

Line arrows are directional markers. These arrowhead-shaped markers are intended to always point to the closest exit. Never put a line arrow on a line unless you are certain it points to the closest exit.

Non-directional markers come in a variety of shapes. The most common is the cookie. It has guideline slots like a line arrow, but rather than being shaped like an arrowhead, it is a round disk. Another common non-directional marker is the reference marker.

Non-directional markers are to be used when you are either unsure of the direction of the exit, or don’t want to convey directional information to others.

## Chapter 6 Summary

- Cavern diving teams must carry at least one primary reel per team and one safety reel or spool per diver.
- Because cavern divers dive during daylight hours and remain within clear sight of the entrance, the sun counts as the primary source of light for cavern diving.
- The stainless steel bolt snap is ideal for cave and cavern use.
- The line cutter is the preferred cutting tool for cavern and cave diving.
- Line markers fall into one of two categories: directional and non-directional.

# Chapter 7: Planning

Every cave diving plan includes six components that also apply to most cavern dives. These are:

- Sequence
- Air
- Depth
- Time
- Distance
- Direction

## Sequence

A tenet of cavern and cave diving is that we stay together. We do not leave a teammate behind. Cave and cavern divers plan for and adhere to a predefined sequence:

- The first diver in is the team leader. He or she is responsible for installing and retrieving the reel. The team leader is the first diver in and the last diver out.
- The last diver in brings up the rear going in, but leads the way going out.
- If there is a third diver in the team, that diver remains in the middle both entering and exiting.

On simple, linear (in-and-out along the same route) dives, when cave divers “call” the dive, each team member maintains his or her position, turning in place so that the last person in now leads the way out.

- Cavern diving differs from cave diving in that cave divers spend the vast majority of their time either entering or exiting. They remain in the pre-planned sequence the entire time.
- In contrast, cavern divers will typically run their reel into the cavern, tie off near the back of the cavern, then either explore in the immediate vicinity of the reel, or back and forth along the guideline. At some point, they may untie the reel and move it to another point in the cavern.

> Any time a team is in motion, either entering or exiting the cavern, team members must remain in sequence, the same as cave divers.

This is especially important in poor visibility, where failure to remain in sequence can result in leaving a team member behind. It falls to the team leader to ensure that he or she never “pulls” a reel without first making sure that every team member is present and accounted for and is exiting the cavern ahead of the team leader.

## Air

Cave divers adhere to the principle that, at any point during the dive, each diver needs to have twice the gas he or she theoretically needs to exit.

> Cavern divers follow the same principle as cave divers, keeping at least two-thirds of their starting gas volume in reserve to exit the cavern.

## Depth

In most instances, you will know the maximum depth of the cavern you are entering before the dive. As long as that depth is within normal cavern diving limits, and the training and experience of each team member, no problem. However,

> If the depth of the cavern exceeds the limits of any team member, your plan must include a maximum allowable depth, which no team member will exceed.

Depth will also impact your allowable No-Decompression Limit (NDL). In most instances, cavern divers have little difficulty staying well within NDLs. Remember: Every cavern dive must be a no-decompression dive.

## Time

In most instances, it is likely you and your team members will be exiting the cavern well before nearing your no-deco limit, but no-deco time may become an issue in deeper caverns.

> If the depth of the cavern increases the possibility of exceeding a no-decompression limit, you must include a time limit as part of your dive plan.

Again, every cavern dive must be a no-decompression dive.

## Distance

The general standard of practice for cavern diving is to limit penetration to 60 m/200 ft. This is measured from the surface, rather than from the cavern entrance.

In most caverns, you can’t exceed this distance without either hitting a wall or losing sight of the entrance. There are, however, caverns that are so large you can exceed this limit and still have the entrance clearly in sight.

> If a cavern is so large that there is a risk of accidentally exceeding the maximum penetration distance for cavern diving, your plan must include a landmark that team members agree they will not go past.

## Direction

In smaller caverns, this may not be an issue. There will be only one way in and one direction you can go. Larger caverns, however, may have multiple entrances and/or a choice of which direction you can go after entering.

> In caverns of a certain size, your dive plan may need to include which entrance you will use and which route you will follow after entering.

## The Golden Rule of Cavern Diving

Although not generally listed as part of your dive plan, there is an implied limitation included in every cavern or cave dive:

> Any team member can “call” any dive, at any time and for any reason.

Each team member must be assured he or she can terminate a dive at any time without being overruled or criticized by fellow team members.

## Chapter 7 Summary

- Any time the team is in motion, either entering or exiting the cavern, they need to remain in sequence, the same as cave divers.
- Cavern divers follow the same principle as cave divers, keeping at least two-thirds of their starting gas volume in reserve to exit the cavern.
- If the depth of the cavern exceeds the limits of any team member, your plan must include a maximum allowable depth, which no team member will exceed.
- If the depth of the cavern increases the possibility of exceeding a no-decompression limit, you must include a time limit as part of your dive plan.
- If a cavern is so large that there is a risk of accidentally exceeding the maximum penetration distance for cavern diving, your plan must include a landmark that team members agree they will not go past.
- In caverns of a certain size, your dive plan may need to include which entrance you will use and which route you will follow after entering.
- Any team member can “call” any dive, at any time and for any reason.

# Chapter 8: Gas Management

While cavern and cave divers can experience any number of problems while diving, the one true emergency is being suddenly without gas to breathe. This is why gas management is the most important aspect of dive planning.

Here we’ll look at how you can prevent out-of-air emergencies through proper dive planning.

## Terminology

Throughout this chapter, we use three terms. These are:

- Usable gas: The volume of gas any team member can use before it’s time to terminate the dive and head for the exit.
- Turnaround point: A value determined by subtracting usable gas from actual starting volume.
- Controlling diver: The controlling diver is the one with the least actual starting gas volume. He or she will be the one that determines the usable gas for both himself and his buddy or team.

## Thirds: It’s for Cavern Divers Too

The “Rule of Thirds” calls for cave divers to use one-third of their gas supply for entering and exploring, one-third for exiting, and leave one-third remaining in reserve for emergencies. No matter where they are in the cave and what they are doing, they plan to have twice as much gas in reserve as they theoretically need to exit the cave.

Why do cavern divers need to adhere to this rule? After all, cavern divers are supposed to remain within 60 m/200 ft of the surface. The gas need to cover this distance wouldn’t be that much, right?

The problem is the amount of gas needed to swim out from your maximum point of penetration makes no allowances for the time needed to:

- Search for a lost teammate
- Find a lost guideline
- Deal with entanglement or entrapment
- Make a safety stop

While you can estimate the amount of gas needed to simply swim out of the cavern, there is no way to predict how much gas you would need to solve any of the problems listed above.

> The best approach is to adhere to the Rule of Thirds or a more conservative plan.

## Simple Turnaround Calulations

Turnaround calculations have the potential to be exceedingly complex. Whenever possible, it makes sense to keep them as simple as possible.

### When you can “keep it simple”

There are two situations in which individual team members diving open circuit can do their own gas turnaround calculations, independent of other team members. These are:

- Sidemount divers: If all team members are on sidemount, they can calculate their turnaround pressure independent of other team members. Why? Because, should they have a problem with one sidemount cylinder, they should be able to easily exit the cavern with the gas in the remaining cylinder.
- Teams of three: Teams of three are considered the ideal cavern and cave diving team because, should one member suffer a catastrophic loss of gas, there will be two potential donors.

Sample Rule of Thirds calculations

When you can calculate your turnaround pressure independent of other team members, doing so becomes relatively easy. The steps are:

- If your starting cylinder pressure is not already a number easily divisible by three, round it down to the next value that is.
- Divide the rounded-down number by three. The result is your usable gas.
- Subtract your usable gas value from your actual starting pressure. The result will be your turnaround pressure.

[!image](/img/099.jpg)

Remember:

> The single biggest mistake divers make when calculating turnaround pressures is that they subtract their usable gas value from the rounded-down number, rather than from their actual starting pressure.

Let’s look at some examples:

Metric example: We’ll assume your starting pressure is 190 bar.

- 190 is not easily divisible by three, so you round down to a value that is: 180 bar.
- One-third of 180, or 60 bar, is your usable gas.
- By deducting 60 from your actual starting pressure of 190 bar, you get a turnaround pressure of 130 bar.

Imperial example: We’ll assume your staring pressure is 2,900 psi.

- As 2,900 is not easily divisible by three, you round down to a value that is: 2,700 psi.
- One-third of 2700, or 900 psi, is your usable gas.
- By deducting 900 from your actual starting pressure of 2,900 psi, you get a turnaround pressure of 2,000 psi.

## Simple Gas Matching

The term gas matching refers to what you do when members of a buddy team have significantly differing starting gas volumes. An example would be when one diver is using a single cylinder while his or her buddy uses doubles.

Let’s assume both divers begin a dive with the same starting pressure, follow the Rule of Thirds and hit their turnaround pressure simultaneously. At this point:

- The diver in doubles has more than sufficient gas to get both himself and his buddy out of the cavern.
- The diver in the single does not. In fact, he’s not even close.

To deal with this, cavern divers can use the gas matching technique to establish the safest possible turnaround points.

> When both buddies are using the same size cylinders, gas matching is only slightly more complex than it is when divers determine turnaround pressures independently of their teammates.

The procedure is:

- Start by identifying the controlling diver. As both divers are using the same size cylinder, this would be the diver with the lowest starting pressure.
- The controlling diver then determines his usable gas as outlined above.
- At this point, both divers subtract the controlling diver’s usable gas from their actual starting pressures to determine their individual turnaround pressures.

**Metric example**: Francois is starting the dive with 240 bar; his buddy, Heinrich, has 170 bar, which makes Heinrich the controlling diver.

- Following the procedure outlined above, Heinrich determines that his usable gas is one-third of 150 bar, or 50 bar.
- At this point, both divers subtract Heinrich’s usable gas from their actual starting pressure. This gives Francois a turnaround pressure of 190 bar and Heinrich a turnaround pressure of 120 bar.

What this means is that, at any point, either diver (theoretically) has sufficient gas to get himself and his buddy out of the cavern.

**Imperial example**: Bob is starting the dive with 3,300 psi; his buddy, Justin, has 2,800 psi, which makes Justin the controlling diver.

- Following the procedure outlined above, Justin determines that his usable gas is one-third of 2,700 psi, or 900 psi.
- At this point, both divers subtract Justin’s usable gas from their actual starting pressure. This gives Bob a turnaround pressure of 2,400 psi and Justin a turnaround pressure of 1,900 psi.

Again, this means that, at any point, either diver (theoretically) has sufficient gas to get himself and his buddy out of the cavern.

## Dissimilar Cylinders

Turnaround calculations can get complicated when teammates are using dissimilar cylinders—especially when using Imperial units of measure instead of metric. When buddies are using cylinders of different capacities, you can no longer base your turnaround calculations solely on starting pressure.

If you want your calculations to be precise, you must account for the fact that the same pressure in two dissimilar cylinders does not mean the cylinders are of equal volume.

The procedure is largely the same as before, with a few wrinkles:

- Identify the controlling diver: This may not be the same as the diver with the lowest starting pressure, if that diver is using a substantially larger cylinder. You will need to do some math or look up values on a table.
- The controlling diver determines his or her usable gas: This part is largely the same as before.
- The non-controlling buddy converts this value to an equivalent pressure in his or her cylinder: More math required.

Each team member subtracts his or her unique usable gas value from his or her actual starting pressure: This is the easy part.

**Metric example**: Francois is using a single 15-liter cylinder and is starting the dive with 160 bar. His buddy, Heinrich, is using a single 12-liter cylinder filled to 180 bar.

- To determine who is the controlling diver, each diver multiplies his cylinder capacity by his starting pressure in bar.
- With a little over 2,100 liters to his partner’s 2,400 liters, Heinrich is the controlling diver—despite having the higher starting pressure.
- Heinrich determines that his usable gas is one-third of 180 bar, or 60 bar. Multiplying 60 bar by 12 liters, this value also represents 720 liters of equivalent surface gas.
- Francois determines that 720 liters is represented by 48 bar, making this his usable gas.
- Each diver subtracts his usable gas value from his actual starting pressure. This makes Francois’ turnaround pressure 112 bar and Heinrich’s 120 bar.

If this seems complex, check out the calculation using Imperial measurements.

**Imperial example**: Bob is using a single high pressure 120 cubic foot cylinder and is starting the dive with 2,400 psi. His buddy, Dustin, is using a single high pressure 80-cubic foot cylinder filled to 3,300 psi.

- To determine who the controlling diver is, each diver consults the table appearing in the Appendix.
- With 77 cubic feet to his partner’s 84 cubic feet, Dustin is the controlling diver—despite having the higher starting pressure.
- Dustin determines that his usable gas is one-third of 3,300 psi, or 1,100 psi. According to the table, this value also represents 26 cubic feet of gas.
- Bob determines that in his cylinder, 26 cubic feet is represented by 700 psi, making this his usable gas.
- Each diver subtracts his usable gas value from his actual starting pressure. This makes Bob’s turnaround pressure 1,700 psi and Dustin’s 2,200 psi.

## Gas Matching for Cavern Diving

At this point, you may be thinking, Is it really this complicated? It depends on whom you ask.

- Some believe precise gas matching calculations are essential for all overhead-environment diving, even in caverns.
- Others believe doing so makes things overly complicated, given the limited penetration distances associated with diving in caverns.

Who is right? Consider the following:

- Precise gas turnaround calculations can’t always be done prior to entering the water. If your cylinders have been sitting out in the hot sun, or lying overnight in near-freezing conditions, you may find your actual starting pressure changes by as much as 20 bar or 300 psi once your tanks adjust to water temperature. You won’t know for sure until you have been in the water for several minutes. For this reason, final turnaround calculations should be done after all other pre-dive checks are completed.
- Dissimilar cylinder calculations require that you either have an equivalent volume table handy or you use a baseline multiplier value, which requires the ability to accurately multiply and divide.
- When you factor in all the variables that come into play in a gas-sharing situation, many people believe that a disparity in starting volumes is only significant if it exceeds 15 to 20 percent or more. And that’s in caves, not caverns.
- In cavern diving, we are primarily concerned with having sufficient reserve gas to solve problems such as being lost, entrapment or entanglement. As you read earlier in the chapter, the amount of gas required to simply exit the cavern is comparatively small—even if sharing gas with another diver.

Given these factors, what should you do? Consider this:

> Many divers believe complex gas calculations are not necessary for cavern diving.

They assert that by using the Rule of Thirds calculation, cavern divers should have more than sufficient gas to deal with contingencies. There is no evidence to the contrary. Remember, this is only for cavern diving, not cave diving.

You must decide which set of limits you want to follow. No one can do this for you.

## Chapter 8 Summary

- Always keep at least two-thirds of your starting gas volume in reserve to solve problems and then exit the cavern.
- The single biggest mistake divers make when calculating turn pressures is that they subtract their usable gas value from the rounded-down number rather than from their actual starting pressure.
- When both buddies are using the same size cylinders, gas matching is only slightly more complex than it is when divers determine turn pressures independently of their teammates.
- If you want your calculations to be precise when using dissimilar cylinders, you have to account for the fact that the same pressure in two dissimilar cylinders does not mean the cylinders are of equal volume.
- Some divers believe complex gas calculations aren’t necessary for cavern diving.
