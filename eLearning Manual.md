# Chapter 1: Introduction

In this chapter, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What is an overhead environment?
- What is cavern diving?
- Why take Cavern Diver training?
- What can you expect during your Cavern Diver course?

## What Is An Overhead Environment?

An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.

## What is Cavern Diving?

Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within sight of the entrance.

Any time divers venture beyond sight of the cavern entrance, they are cave diving and not cavern diving. And, when the sun goes down, every cavern is considered a cave.

Cavern diving differs from cave diving in the following ways:

Cavern diving requires little more than standard single-tank, sport-diving equipment. Cave diving requires highly specialized equipment, such as backmount or sidemount doubles.
divers_gearing_up

TDI Full Cave Diver certification requires a minimum of six or more days of training and 16 or more dives. TDI Cavern Diver certification requires as little as two days of training and four dives.

Cave diving is a form of technical diving that takes divers beyond accepted sport-diving limits. Cavern diving takes place within normal sport-diving depth and time limits.

## Cavern Diver Training Benefits

Why take part in TDI Cavern Diver training?

> The benefits of Cavern Diver training go beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.

- Cavern diving helps divers develop exceptional buoyancy control and trim.
- It helps divers streamline their equipment to avoid entanglement and improve overall function.
- It introduces advanced dive planning procedures used by technical divers. In fact, the Cavern Diver course closely parallels the TDI Intro to Tech Diver course.
- It is the first step in a process that can lead to TDI Introductory Cave Diver and Full Cave Diver certification. It is also a good precursor to Advanced Wreck Diver training.

## About the Cavern Diver Course

The TDI Cavern Diver course consists of:

- Self-study
- Academic review
- Guideline and emergency skill practice on dry land
- Guideline and emergency skill practice in shallow water
- Several cavern dives

The Cavern Diver course emphasizes the importance of pre-planning and gas management when exploring overhead environments. Why?

> When diving in open water, divers generally can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an overhead obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

## Chapter 1: Summary

- An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.
- Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within direct sight of the entrance.
- The benefits inherent in taking Cavern Diver training goes beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.
- When diving in open water, divers can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

# Chapter 2: Land

## Landowner Relations and Conservation

To be able to go cavern diving, we first need a place to dive. This can only happen if:

- Landowners grant permission to dive.
- We protect the fragile cavern environment so it’s worth diving there.

Here, we’ll discuss the diver’s responsibility in landowner relations and conservation.

### Landowner Relations

When dealing with the individuals, organizations and government entities that either own the land on which the caverns and caves you dive are located, or own the land that provides access to these sites, remember these two key points:

- There is no unowned land.
- Our access depends on following the rules.
- There is no unowned land.

Do not assume that undeveloped, unfenced or unposted land “doesn’t really belong to anyone.” It does—and regardless of whether the owner is an individual, business or organization, or a government agency, the owner has the right to allow or deny access to the property.

Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.

This goes beyond just avoiding arrest for trespassing. Future access to the site may depend on cavern and cave divers gaining a reputation as people who respect property rights.

**Our access depends on following the rules.**

Most popular underwater caverns and caves are located in government controlled or privately operated parks and recreation sites. These sites typically have and enforce various rules applying to divers of different training and experience levels.

> Understand and follow all rules in effect at dive sites.

Your willingness to follow the rules may determine if you and others are allowed future access to popular sites.

## Cavern and Cave Conservation

Underwater caverns and caves are fragile environments that must be treated with respect and care.

To avoid damaging a cavern or cave site: **Match the site to your skill level.**

Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.

Use the right propulsion technique. The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

Remember that any damage you cause to the fragile cavern/cave environment will be visible forever. Fragile stone formations and speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) take tens of thousands of years to form. Once damaged they will not grow back.

Even something as seemingly innocuous as a hand or fin print in a bed of clay can remain visible beyond our lifetimes. The only possible way to deal with such damage is to prevent it.

## Chapter 2: Summary

- Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.
- Understand and follow the rules at the dive site.
- Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.
- The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

# Chapter 3: Cave Type and Formation

The more you know about the environment in which you dive, the more you will appreciate and enjoy the experience. This is as true of caverns as it is of coral reefs.

In this chapter, we answer the following questions:

- What are the different types of caves and caverns?
- How do solution caves and caverns form?

## Cave Types

There are at least four different cavern and cave types.

The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes and solution caves.

Let’s take a look at what makes each type unique.

### Coral caves

Coral caves typically form when the tops of adjacent coral reefs grow together, forming tunnels and arches. They are common along the edges of walls and drop-offs.

### Sea caves

Formed by wave action eroding limestone or other soft rock, sea caves tend to penetrate the cliffs in which they form for only a short distance. During all but the highest tides, the ceilings of most sea caves are open to air.

### Lava tubes

A byproduct of volcanic eruptions, lava tubes form when the outside of a lava flow cools and hardens, while the interior remains molten. If the lava flow abruptly terminates, the molten core may empty out, leaving a hollow conduit.

### Solution caves

These form when the carbonic acid present in groundwater dissolves soft rock, such as limestone or dolomite. Solution caves often form a series of complex, maze-like passageways.

Most caverns and caves are found in karst topography, which is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and gypsum.

## Karst Topography

_(Note: This section inserted by me. -Ed.)_

**Karst topography** is a distinctive type of landscape formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, primarily limestone, dolomite, and gypsum.

### Key Characteristics

- **Formation:** Created when slightly acidic water (from rain or groundwater) dissolves carbonate bedrock over thousands of years
- **Surface features:** Sinkholes, disappearing streams, springs, and irregular rocky terrain
- **Underground features:** Extensive cave systems, underground rivers, and caverns

### Relevance to Cave Diving

Karst topography is directly responsible for creating the cave systems that divers explore. Florida, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and many other popular cave diving destinations are karst regions where this geological process has created vast underwater cave networks.

The dissolution process creates:

- **Cenotes** (Mexico) - natural sinkholes providing access to underwater caves
- **Springs** (Florida) - outlets where underground water emerges
- **Cave passages** - dissolved conduits through the limestone

This geological feature is fundamental to understanding why caves exist in certain regions and how they continue to evolve over time.

## Solution Cave Formation

Most karst terrain is nothing but layer upon layer of limestone, or calcium carbonate, covered with a thin layer of sand and clay. Limestone is a highly porous rock; the limestone in most karst regions is especially porous. Water moves easily between the loosely compacted particles and shells that comprise most of this rock.

When rain falls on karst terrain, the ground absorbs it almost immediately. Before it is absorbed, the rainwater acquires carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and the decaying organic matter it passes through. When combined with the hydrogen and oxygen in water (H2O), the carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid (H2CO3).

[!image](/img/027.jpg)

The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.

[!image](/img/028.jpg)

One example of this solution process is called spongework. This occurs when carbonic acid dissolves pockets of softer limestone, leaving rock that resembles Swiss cheese.

[!image](/img/029.jpg)

When rain falls on highly porous karst terrain, it is absorbed into the ground, saturating the limestone below.

[!image](/img/030.jpg)

Rivers passing through the region often have water levels lower than the surrounding water table. Gravity creates a tendency for water to move sideways through the rock as the water tries to run downhill.

[!image](/img/031.jpg)

Ground water seeks the path of least resistance. This can include bedding planes (the boundary between limestone layers), fractures in the rock and even interconnecting spongework. As this takes place, the carbonic acid works to further dissolve these conduits.

When passage diameter exceeds nine centimeters, the rate of dissolution accelerates. Thus, the biggest conduits for water flow tend to become even bigger over time. Eventually, these can form an interconnecting maze of cave passageways.

[!image](/img/032.jpg)

Mature cave systems may surface in a spring basin, away from the river, and connect to the river by a spring run.

## Cavern and Cave Entrance Types

Cavern and cave entrances may be either springs or siphons. A sinkhole or karst window may have both.

Springs exist where water flows out of the ground. Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.

Siphons form in one of two ways.

[!image](/img/33.jpg)

If the level of adjacent rivers rises above that of the water table, karst openings that are normally springs may temporarily siphon.

[!image](/img/34.jpg)

The development of sinkholes over underground rivers often creates openings with a spring on one side and a siphon on the other.

Diving springs is almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

The opposite is true for siphons. Additionally, divers entering siphons may experience substantially lower visibility than divers entering springs—especially in areas where siphons ingest tannic-stained water from adjacent rivers.

## Chapter 3 Summary

- The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes, and solution caves.
- The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.
- Springs exist where water flows out of the ground.
- Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.
- Diving springs are almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort, and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

# Chapter 4: Environmental Risks

Now that you know where underwater caverns and caves come from, it’s time to talk about the risks associated with diving them. To do this, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What are the risks associated with diving overhead environments?
- Why do siphons pose a greater risk than springs?
- What can cause loss of visibility and why is it a problem?
- What are restrictions and why should you avoid them?
- What are line traps and why should you avoid them?

## Overhead Environments

Aquatic environments can pose many risks for divers, the greatest of which is being out of breathing gas while underwater.

> Divers in open water almost always have the ability to make a direct ascent to the surface.

A direct ascent to the surface is not possible when cavern diving.

## Loss of Visibility

Why be concerned with maintaining good visibility?

> Loss of visibility can trigger more serious problems.

They include:

- Disorientation and confusion.
- Buddy separation and impeded communication.
- Losing sight of the guideline or exit.
- Substantially slower exit times; especially if divers need to spend time locating the guideline, the exit, or each other.

Loss of visibility can be caused by:

- Poor starting visibility.
- Siphoning.
- Disturbance of silts and sediments.

### Poor starting visibility

If the visibility inside a cavern is poor when entering, it will not likely improve. On the other hand, if you start in good visibility, a slight decrease in overall visibility is not likely to be a problem.

#### Siphoning

Siphons can suck in dark, tannic-laden river water or algae from an adjacent open-water basin. This can severely lower visibility.

#### Silt

Given good starting visibility, the greatest risk of loss of visibility comes from the disturbance of silt. Silt is a broad term that actually describes a range of sediments.

[!image](/img/38.jpg)

_(Note: I have only included this graphic because I think it's hilarious. -Ed.)_

- At one end of the continuum is sand. While easily disturbed, it drops out of suspension almost immediately.
- At the other end of the continuum is clay. While harder to disturb, once you do so it can take up to 24 hours or more to settle.

The best way to handle silting problems is to avoid them.

- Silt is common in areas with low flow, so be aware of water movement—or lack of it—in caverns.
- Pay attention to the bottom composition and learn to distinguish between sand, mud and clay.

To avoid or reduce silting, perfect your buoyancy control, trim and propulsion techniques.

## Siphons

Avoid siphons whenever possible, because:

> Siphons are often associated with poor visibility. Siphoning can make it difficult or impossible to exit a cavern.

Diving a siphon requires more time, energy and breathing gas to exit a cavern than you used when entering.
A mild siphon near the cavern entrance can turn into an overpowering one farther in. This poses an entrapment risk. The best way to deal with siphons is to avoid them.

## Restrictions

Among the limits of Cavern Diver training is a prohibition against passing through restrictions.

> A restriction is a passage or opening too narrow for divers to pass through side by side.

[!image](/img/40.jpg)

Negotiating restrictions, including air-sharing while passing through a restriction, requires specialized training that is not a part of Cavern Diver training. Minor restrictions are covered in the TDI Intro Cave and TDI Full Cave courses.

## Line Traps

Line traps are openings into which divers may accidentally pull the guideline but are too narrow for the divers to pass through.

[!image](/img/41.jpg)

> Line traps are dangerous because they prevent divers from exiting the cavern using the guideline. The ability to follow a guideline is critically important in low visibility.

When running reels, check behind you frequently to ensure your guideline has not fallen into a line trap.

## Chapter 4 Summary

- Divers in open water almost always have the ability to make a direct ascent to the surface. A direct ascent is not possible when cavern diving.
- Loss of visibility can trigger serious problems including disorientation and confusion, buddy separation and impeded communication, losing sight of the guideline or exit, and slower exit times.
- Siphons are often associated with poor visibility. Siphoning can make it difficult or impossible to exit a cavern.
- A restriction is a passage or opening too narrow for divers to pass through side by side.
- Line traps are dangerous because they prevent divers from exiting the cavern using the guideline. The ability to follow a guideline is critically important in low visibility.

# Chapter 5: Equipment

In this course we will determine if your current open-water gear is suitable for cavern diving and, if so, what modifications may be required before using it in overhead environments.

Equipment used for single-cylinder diving in open water can be modified for cavern diving. Specialized equipment including backmount or sidemount double cylinders or closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) can also be used for cavern diving.

If you intend to use backmount or sidemount doubles during the Cavern Diver course, you must already be properly trained to do so.

> Cavern diving equipment must meet specific objectives.

These objectives include:

- Securing or removing any dangling equipment that could cause entanglement, disturb silt or damage fragile cave formations.
- Eliminating unnecessary accessory items.
- Making critical equipment items instantly accessible by feel.
- Equipping for a streamlined and properly trimmed body position in the water.

## Mask, Snorkel, and Fins

The mask and fins you already own will likely be suitable for cavern diving.

### Masks and Snorkels

> Nearly any mask that fits well is suitable for cavern diving.

Snorkels are not used for cavern diving because they are an entanglement risk and are useless in overhead environments.

Most cave and technical divers carry a backup mask that can be stowed in a pocket.

### Fins

Only open-heel scuba fins are adequate for cavern diving. They must be designed to allow specialized propulsion techniques used by cavern divers to avoid silting.

Split and hinged fins generally do not work well when doing the frog kick, helicopter turn, or modified flutter kick used by cavern divers to avoid silting.

#### Avoiding strap problems

Loose or dangling straps are a guideline entanglement hazard.

> Mask and fins straps must be secured.

Before easily adjustable, quick-release fin strap buckles were developed, cavern and cave divers taped the loose ends of fin straps so that they could not snare the guideline. This isn’t necessary with most modern fins.

A better alternative is to use spring or elastic heel straps. These are standard on most technical diving fins and available as an after-market accessory for most others.

A good way to rid your mask of loose strap ends is to replace it with a neoprene strap that has no loose ends. Another approach is to wear your mask strap under your hood. Doing this also helps prevent mask loss.

## Exposure Suits

Hypothermia is a potentially dangerous drop in body temperature usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Choosing the right exposure protection is important.

Factors to consider when selecting exposure protection include surface temperature, water temperature, length of exposure and depth.

A full-length exposure suit is essential in nearly all cavern environments. This is typically a 5-mm or thicker wetsuit. As temperatures drop below 24° C/75? F, a dry suit might be a better option.

### Exposure suit accessories

Hoods: A well-fitting hood is an important exposure protection accessory.

Thigh pockets: BC and harness-mounted pockets tend to have limited capacity and may be hard to access. Thigh pockets found on most dry suits have greater capacity and are easier to use. You can easily add thigh pockets to most wetsuits.

## Regulators

Here we will discuss using a normal sport-diving regulator attached to a single cylinder.

If using a single regulator first stage, it must be capable of supplying gas to two divers at depth.

A gas-sharing situation at depth puts considerable demand on a first stage.

## Alternate-Air-Source Configuration

A conventional sport-diving regulator system can be easily modified for cavern diving. It usually features:

- A short primary second stage hose.
- A slightly longer alternate-air-source second stage hose.
- An equally long high-pressure hose ending in an instrument console.

The sport-diving equipment configuration shown here has inherent drawbacks for cavern use, including:

- The longer alternate-air-source second stage can be harder to locate and pass quickly to an out-of-air diver.
- It is easy to accidentally pass the alternate upside down, which can cause the recipient to inhale water, adding to panic.
- As usually configured, the alternate-air-source hose presents a snagging risk.
- Although you can use a conventional alternate-air-source second stage for cavern diving, consider switching to a primary second stage with a long hose for gas sharing.

The equipment configuration shown here offers several benefits, including:

- It allows you to pass the primary second stage to a distressed diver, allowing you to initiate gas sharing faster.
- Your natural wrist motion when passing a primary second stage tends to keep it right-side up.
- While many conventional “octopus” second stages are not designed for ease of breathing, your primary second stage should offer excellent performance. This is exactly what an out-of-gas diver needs.
- Because your backup second stage is worn on a necklace, it stays within easy reach.

This configuration is streamlined and reduces the risk of snagged hoses.

Inflator hoses that feature integrated regulators, which also suppose a potential donor will be passing his or her primary second stage, offer many of the same benefits. However, if not secured properly, the inflator hose may present an entanglement risk.

## BC Air Cell, Harness and Weight System

Cavern divers must equip and train to avoid silting.

> Your buoyancy compensator (BC) air cell, harness and weight system must be configured to help you maintain proper horizontal trim.

Modern weight-integrated BCs, especially those with trim weight pockets located on the upper portion of the BC, are preferred over traditional weight belts worn on the waist because the weights can be distributed along your body’s natural balance point.

Many students use the Cavern Diver course as an opportunity to switch to a harness and air cell system commonly used by cavern and cave divers. The benefits of these systems include:

- The back-mounted air cell may help in maintaining proper trim. Users can switch to air cells of different sizes.
- Modular systems make it possible to reposition D-rings or add accessories such as weight pockets.
- Many modular systems allow the same harness to be adapted for use with doubles or sidemount.

If your ultimate goal is to progress to cave or tech diver training, consider investing in a modular harness and air cell system.

## Instrumentation

Just as in open water, your dive data must be readily accessible when cavern diving.

Your instrumentation needs to include a means of monitoring depth, time, no-decompression status and cylinder pressure.

Minimum instrumentation for cavern diving includes:

- A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) calibrated in either 10-bar or 100-psi increments. This is crucial for dive planning and gas management.
- A means of monitoring both depth and time, such as a dive computer or depth gauge and timer.

Additionally:

- If you have a gas-integrated dive computer that reads cylinder pressure, plan to back it up with a mechanical gauge.
- Do not rely on a single means of monitoring depth, time, and no-decompression status. This means equipping with a backup dive computer or dive tables.
- Instruments such as thermometers and compasses have little value in cavern diving.
- All equipment must be attached securely to the diver’s BC or harness. Dangling gear is an entanglement hazard.

Most cave and technical divers avoid using a multi-gauge instrument console, relying instead on a mechanical SPG on a relatively short high-pressure hose. They use wrist-mounted dive computers and depth gauge/timers.

## Chapter 5 Summary

- Cavern diving equipment must meet specific objectives.
- Nearly any mask used for open-water diving is suitable for cavern diving.
- Mask and fin straps must be secured to prevent possible snagging.
- Snorkels are not used for cavern diving because they are an entanglement risk and are useless in overhead environments.
- Factors to consider when selecting exposure protection include surface temperature, water temperature, length of exposure and depth.
- If using a single regulator first stage, it must be capable of supplying gas to two divers at depth.
