# Chapter 1: Introduction

In this chapter, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What is an overhead environment?
- What is cavern diving?
- Why take Cavern Diver training?
- What can you expect during your Cavern Diver course?

## What Is An Overhead Environment?

An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.

## What is Cavern Diving?

Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within sight of the entrance.

Any time divers venture beyond sight of the cavern entrance, they are cave diving and not cavern diving. And, when the sun goes down, every cavern is considered a cave.

Cavern diving differs from cave diving in the following ways:

Cavern diving requires little more than standard single-tank, sport-diving equipment. Cave diving requires highly specialized equipment, such as backmount or sidemount doubles.

TDI Full Cave Diver certification requires a minimum of six or more days of training and 16 or more dives. TDI Cavern Diver certification requires as little as two days of training and four dives.

Cave diving is a form of technical diving that takes divers beyond accepted sport-diving limits. Cavern diving takes place within normal sport-diving depth and time limits.

## Cavern Diver Training Benefits

Why take part in TDI Cavern Diver training?

> The benefits of Cavern Diver training go beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.

- Cavern diving helps divers develop exceptional buoyancy control and trim.
- It helps divers streamline their equipment to avoid entanglement and improve overall function.
- It introduces advanced dive planning procedures used by technical divers. In fact, the Cavern Diver course closely parallels the TDI Intro to Tech Diver course.
- It is the first step in a process that can lead to TDI Introductory Cave Diver and Full Cave Diver certification. It is also a good precursor to Advanced Wreck Diver training.

## About the Cavern Diver Course

The TDI Cavern Diver course consists of:

- Self-study
- Academic review
- Guideline and emergency skill practice on dry land
- Guideline and emergency skill practice in shallow water
- Several cavern dives

The Cavern Diver course emphasizes the importance of pre-planning and gas management when exploring overhead environments. Why?

> When diving in open water, divers generally can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an overhead obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

- The benefits inherent in taking Cavern Diver training goes beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.
- When diving in open water, divers can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

# Chapter 2: Land

## Landowner Relations and Conservation

To be able to go cavern diving, we first need a place to dive. This can only happen if:

- Landowners grant permission to dive.
- We protect the fragile cavern environment so it’s worth diving there.

Here, we’ll discuss the diver’s responsibility in landowner relations and conservation.

### Landowner Relations

When dealing with the individuals, organizations and government entities that either own the land on which the caverns and caves you dive are located, or own the land that provides access to these sites, remember these two key points:

- There is no unowned land.
- Our access depends on following the rules.
- There is no unowned land.

Do not assume that undeveloped, unfenced or unposted land “doesn’t really belong to anyone.” It does—and regardless of whether the owner is an individual, business or organization, or a government agency, the owner has the right to allow or deny access to the property.

Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.

This goes beyond just avoiding arrest for trespassing. Future access to the site may depend on cavern and cave divers gaining a reputation as people who respect property rights.

**Our access depends on following the rules.**

Most popular underwater caverns and caves are located in government controlled or privately operated parks and recreation sites. These sites typically have and enforce various rules applying to divers of different training and experience levels.

> Understand and follow all rules in effect at dive sites.

Your willingness to follow the rules may determine if you and others are allowed future access to popular sites.

## Cavern and Cave Conservation

Underwater caverns and caves are fragile environments that must be treated with respect and care.

To avoid damaging a cavern or cave site: **Match the site to your skill level.**

Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.

Use the right propulsion technique. The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

Remember that any damage you cause to the fragile cavern/cave environment will be visible forever. Fragile stone formations and speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) take tens of thousands of years to form. Once damaged they will not grow back.

Even something as seemingly innocuous as a hand or fin print in a bed of clay can remain visible beyond our lifetimes. The only possible way to deal with such damage is to prevent it.

## Chapter 2: Summary

- Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.
- Understand and follow the rules at the dive site.
- Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.
- The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.
