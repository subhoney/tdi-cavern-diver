# Chapter 1: Introduction

In this chapter, we’ll answer the following questions:

- What is an overhead environment?
- What is cavern diving?
- Why take Cavern Diver training?
- What can you expect during your Cavern Diver course?

## What Is An Overhead Environment?

An overhead environment is any underwater setting with an obstruction (a submerged wreck or natural feature) that prevents a diver from making a direct ascent to the surface.

## What is Cavern Diving?

Cavern diving is the exploration of natural overhead environments during daylight hours and within sight of the entrance.

Any time divers venture beyond sight of the cavern entrance, they are cave diving and not cavern diving. And, when the sun goes down, every cavern is considered a cave.

Cavern diving differs from cave diving in the following ways:

Cavern diving requires little more than standard single-tank, sport-diving equipment. Cave diving requires highly specialized equipment, such as backmount or sidemount doubles.

TDI Full Cave Diver certification requires a minimum of six or more days of training and 16 or more dives. TDI Cavern Diver certification requires as little as two days of training and four dives.

Cave diving is a form of technical diving that takes divers beyond accepted sport-diving limits. Cavern diving takes place within normal sport-diving depth and time limits.

## Cavern Diver Training Benefits

Why take part in TDI Cavern Diver training?

> The benefits of Cavern Diver training go beyond simply learning how to safely cavern dive.

- Cavern diving helps divers develop exceptional buoyancy control and trim.
- It helps divers streamline their equipment to avoid entanglement and improve overall function.
- It introduces advanced dive planning procedures used by technical divers. In fact, the Cavern Diver course closely parallels the TDI Intro to Tech Diver course.
- It is the first step in a process that can lead to TDI Introductory Cave Diver and Full Cave Diver certification. It is also a good precursor to Advanced Wreck Diver training.

## About the Cavern Diver Course

The TDI Cavern Diver course consists of:

- Self-study
- Academic review
- Guideline and emergency skill practice on dry land
- Guideline and emergency skill practice in shallow water
- Several cavern dives

The Cavern Diver course emphasizes the importance of pre-planning and gas management when exploring overhead environments. Why?

> When diving in open water, divers generally can make a direct ascent to the surface without encountering an overhead obstruction. Due to factors such as depth and penetration distance, a direct ascent may not be possible when cavern diving.

# Chapter 2: Land

## Landowner Relations and Conservation

To be able to go cavern diving, we first need a place to dive. This can only happen if:

- Landowners grant permission to dive.
- We protect the fragile cavern environment so it’s worth diving there.

Here, we’ll discuss the diver’s responsibility in landowner relations and conservation.

### Landowner Relations

When dealing with the individuals, organizations and government entities that either own the land on which the caverns and caves you dive are located, or own the land that provides access to these sites, remember these two key points:

- There is no unowned land.
- Our access depends on following the rules.
- There is no unowned land.

Do not assume that undeveloped, unfenced or unposted land “doesn’t really belong to anyone.” It does—and regardless of whether the owner is an individual, business or organization, or a government agency, the owner has the right to allow or deny access to the property.

Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.

This goes beyond just avoiding arrest for trespassing. Future access to the site may depend on cavern and cave divers gaining a reputation as people who respect property rights.

**Our access depends on following the rules.**

Most popular underwater caverns and caves are located in government controlled or privately operated parks and recreation sites. These sites typically have and enforce various rules applying to divers of different training and experience levels.

> Understand and follow all rules in effect at dive sites.

Your willingness to follow the rules may determine if you and others are allowed future access to popular sites.

## Cavern and Cave Conservation

Underwater caverns and caves are fragile environments that must be treated with respect and care.

To avoid damaging a cavern or cave site: **Match the site to your skill level.**

Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.

Use the right propulsion technique. The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

Remember that any damage you cause to the fragile cavern/cave environment will be visible forever. Fragile stone formations and speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) take tens of thousands of years to form. Once damaged they will not grow back.

Even something as seemingly innocuous as a hand or fin print in a bed of clay can remain visible beyond our lifetimes. The only possible way to deal with such damage is to prevent it.

## Chapter 2: Summary

- Before diving any cavern or cave site, determine who the owner is and whether you need express permission to dive.
- Understand and follow the rules at the dive site.
- Make sure whatever site you choose to cavern dive matches your ability, and dive in an environmentally sound manner.
- The best propulsion technique is generally the one that has the least potential to cause damage.

# Chapter 3: Cave Type and Formation

The more you know about the environment in which you dive, the more you will appreciate and enjoy the experience. This is as true of caverns as it is of coral reefs.

In this chapter, we answer the following questions:

- What are the different types of caves and caverns?
- How do solution caves and caverns form?

## Cave Types

There are at least four different cavern and cave types.

The four basic types of underwater caverns and caves are coral caves, sea caves, lava tubes and solution caves.

Let’s take a look at what makes each type unique.

### Coral caves

Coral caves typically form when the tops of adjacent coral reefs grow together, forming tunnels and arches. They are common along the edges of walls and drop-offs.

### Sea caves

Formed by wave action eroding limestone or other soft rock, sea caves tend to penetrate the cliffs in which they form for only a short distance. During all but the highest tides, the ceilings of most sea caves are open to air.

### Lava tubes

A byproduct of volcanic eruptions, lava tubes form when the outside of a lava flow cools and hardens, while the interior remains molten. If the lava flow abruptly terminates, the molten core may empty out, leaving a hollow conduit.

### Solution caves

These form when the carbonic acid present in groundwater dissolves soft rock, such as limestone or dolomite. Solution caves often form a series of complex, maze-like passageways.

Most caverns and caves are found in karst topography, which is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and gypsum.

## Karst Topography

_(Note: This section inserted by me. -Ed.)_

**Karst topography** is a distinctive type of landscape formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, primarily limestone, dolomite, and gypsum.

### Key Characteristics

- **Formation:** Created when slightly acidic water (from rain or groundwater) dissolves carbonate bedrock over thousands of years
- **Surface features:** Sinkholes, disappearing streams, springs, and irregular rocky terrain
- **Underground features:** Extensive cave systems, underground rivers, and caverns

### Relevance to Cave Diving

Karst topography is directly responsible for creating the cave systems that divers explore. Florida, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and many other popular cave diving destinations are karst regions where this geological process has created vast underwater cave networks.

The dissolution process creates:

- **Cenotes** (Mexico) - natural sinkholes providing access to underwater caves
- **Springs** (Florida) - outlets where underground water emerges
- **Cave passages** - dissolved conduits through the limestone

This geological feature is fundamental to understanding why caves exist in certain regions and how they continue to evolve over time.

## Solution Cave Formation

Most karst terrain is nothing but layer upon layer of limestone, or calcium carbonate, covered with a thin layer of sand and clay. Limestone is a highly porous rock; the limestone in most karst regions is especially porous. Water moves easily between the loosely compacted particles and shells that comprise most of this rock.

When rain falls on karst terrain, the ground absorbs it almost immediately. Before it is absorbed, the rainwater acquires carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and the decaying organic matter it passes through. When combined with the hydrogen and oxygen in water (H2O), the carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid (H2CO3).

The carbonic acid in rainwater is chiefly responsible for the formation of solution caverns and caves.

[!image](/img/028.jpg)

One example of this solution process is called spongework. This occurs when carbonic acid dissolves pockets of softer limestone, leaving rock that resembles Swiss cheese.

[!image](/img/029.jpg)

When rain falls on highly porous karst terrain, it is absorbed into the ground, saturating the limestone below.

[!image](/img/030.jpg)

Rivers passing through the region often have water levels lower than the surrounding water table. Gravity creates a tendency for water to move sideways through the rock as the water tries to run downhill.

[!image](/img/031.jpg)

Ground water seeks the path of least resistance. This can include bedding planes (the boundary between limestone layers), fractures in the rock and even interconnecting spongework. As this takes place, the carbonic acid works to further dissolve these conduits.

When passage diameter exceeds nine centimeters, the rate of dissolution accelerates. Thus, the biggest conduits for water flow tend to become even bigger over time. Eventually, these can form an interconnecting maze of cave passageways.

[!image](/img/032.jpg)

Mature cave systems may surface in a spring basin, away from the river, and connect to the river by a spring run.

## Cavern and Cave Entrance Types

Cavern and cave entrances may be either springs or siphons. A sinkhole or karst window may have both.

Springs exist where water flows out of the ground. Siphons exist where water flows into the ground.

Siphons form in one of two ways.

[!image](/img/33.jpg)

If the level of adjacent rivers rises above that of the water table, karst openings that are normally springs may temporarily siphon.

[!image](/img/34.jpg)

The development of sinkholes over underground rivers often creates openings with a spring on one side and a siphon on the other.

Diving springs is almost always safer than diving siphons because divers will require less time, effort and breathing gas to exit a spring than is needed to enter.

The opposite is true for siphons. Additionally, divers entering siphons may experience substantially lower visibility than divers entering springs—especially in areas where siphons ingest tannic-stained water from adjacent rivers.
